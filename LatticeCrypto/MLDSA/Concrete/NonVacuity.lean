# Hypothesis-consistency certificate for `MLDSA.Primitives.Laws` (issue #228)

The ML-DSA correctness and zero-knowledge theorems — `MLDSA.idsWithAbort_complete`
(`MLDSA/Security.lean`), `MLDSA.idsWithAbort_hvzk` (`MLDSA/SecurityHVZK.lean`),
`MLDSA.fipsSign_fipsVerify_correct` (`MLDSA/Signature.lean`), and the algebraic lemmas they run on
(`MLDSA.keyGenFromSeed_wApprox_eq`, `MLDSA.recoverT0_eq`) — are each gated on
`h_laws : Primitives.Laws prims nttOps`.  A conditional theorem asserts nothing if its hypothesis is
uninhabitable, and `#print axioms` cannot detect that.  This file rules that out with a
kernel-checked witness: `Primitives.Laws` is genuinely **inhabitable**.

This is a **logical consistency (inhabitance) witness only**: `seedRevealingPrims` publishes the
key-generation seed as the public `ρ`, so it is neither a faithful nor a secure ML-DSA
instantiation, and no security claim about concrete ML-DSA follows from it.

The witness `seedRevealingPrims` is `concretePrimitives` with the public `ρ`-component of
`expandSeed`
overridden to be the identity in the seed.  Every field consumed by the thirteen banked
`concrete_*` laws is definitionally unchanged, so those laws transfer verbatim; the only remaining
field, the determinacy assumption `keyVector_t0_determined`, holds trivially because the override
makes the published seed-component injective (matching `ρ` forces the same seed, hence the same
`t₀`).  Injectivity of the published seed-component is precisely the structural feature that makes
`keyVector_t0_determined` satisfiable by a deterministic bundle.

**Trust surface.**  `mldsa_laws_inhabited` depends on `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`,
**and** the `native_decide` certificate for the concrete `256×256` NTT matrix inversion
(`MLDSA.Concrete.invNTTMatrix_nttMatrix_entry`, routed in through `concrete_transform`).  That
`native_decide` axiom is carried by every concrete ML-DSA fact (e.g. `concrete_transform` itself),
since `concreteNTTRingOps` is the only `NTTRingLaws` instance in the tree.  The *abstract*
`Laws`-gated theorems (quantified over `nttOps`) are themselves axiom-clean
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`; this certificate only witnesses that their `Laws`
hypothesis can be met by the concrete layer (whose NTT-correctness trust assumption it inherits).

/-- `concretePrimitives p` with the public `ρ`-component of `expandSeed` overridden to be the
identity in the seed.  Every other field — including all fields consumed by the thirteen
`concrete_*` laws — is definitionally equal to `concretePrimitives p`, so those laws transfer
unchanged.  The override makes the published seed-component injective, which is exactly what
`keyVector_t0_determined` needs.

A **logical consistency witness** for `Primitives.Laws`: publishing the seed as `ρ` discards
key secrecy, so this is not a faithful or secure ML-DSA instantiation — it exists to show the
`Laws` hypothesis type is inhabited. -/
