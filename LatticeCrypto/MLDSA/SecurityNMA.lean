# ML-DSA EUF-NMA Security: reduction scaffolding

This file builds the reduction infrastructure for the ML-DSA EUF-NMA analysis — the **seed-based
MLWE key-swap distinguisher** and the **SelfTargetMSIS extractor** — over the real ML-DSA key
generation phrased as a `ProbComp`:

1. **MLWE key-swap.** The honest key generation, where the public key vector is `t = Â · s₁ + s₂`
   (`keygen0`), is compared against a variant `keygen1` that samples `t` uniformly. The seed-based
   MLWE problem `mldsaMLWE` embeds this key distribution, and the distinguisher `distinguisherB`
   turns any NMA forger into an MLWE distinguisher `B` that reconstructs the public key from a
   challenge `(ρ, t)` and runs the forger. The plumbing lemmas `advantage_eq_game_boolDistAdvantage`
   and `nmaGame_eq_keygen_bind` identify the NMA games with the MLWE single-branch games.
2. **SelfTargetMSIS extraction (`nmaAdvantage_keygen1_le_stmsis`).** Once `t` is uniform the key
   carries no secret, so a forgery is a short vector satisfying the SelfTargetMSIS relation; the
   extractor `extractorC` reads `(z, c̃)` out of the forged signature. This is fully proven: the
   shared random-oracle simulation lines up the NMA `verify` query with the extractor's RO read-back
   (`stmsis_tail_le`), and an accepted forgery is a valid SelfTargetMSIS solution by commitment
   recoverability.

The `H₁` reprogramming step of the paper folds into the random-oracle modeling and is not separated
out here.

## What is defined here

The honest ML-DSA key distribution embeds an MLWE instance: sample a public seed `ρ`, set the
public matrix `Â = ExpandA(ρ)`, sample short secrets `(s₁, s₂)`, and publish the `Power2Round`
high half of `t = Â · s₁ + s₂`. The uniform-`t` variant replaces `Â · s₁ + s₂` by a uniform
sample. We package both as `ProbComp` key generators, lift each to an EUF-NMA game over an
arbitrary forging adversary `main`, and exhibit the MLWE distinguisher `B` that interpolates
between them: `B (Â, t)` reconstructs the public key from `(ρ, t)` and runs the adversary.

## Modeling note (seeds, not matrices)

The verifier recomputes `Â = ExpandA(pk.ρ)` from the seed stored in the public key, so the MLWE
challenge matrix `Â` must be presented to the adversary *through* a seed `ρ`. Rather than carrying
an embedding witness `ExpandA(ρ) = Â` (which need not exist, since `ExpandA` is not surjective), we
**re-seed-base** the MLWE problem: the public challenge of `mldsaMLWE` is the *seed* `ρ` itself, and
the matrix is *defined* as `Â := ExpandA(ρ)` wherever it is used, so that
`noiseless s₁ ρ = ExpandA(ρ)·s₁`.
This is the standard ROM modeling of Dilithium with `ExpandA` a random oracle, and it makes the
distinguisher `B` total: it consumes `(ρ, t)` and forms `pk = (ρ, Power2Round(t).1)` directly with
no embedding witness required.

/-- The concrete MLWE problem embedded by ML-DSA key generation, **seed-based**: the public
challenge is the public matrix seed `ρ = (ExpandSeed(seed)).1` for a uniform `seed`, the secret is
`s₁`, and the output is `t`. The matrix is recovered on demand as `Â := ExpandA(ρ)`, so
`noiseless s₁ ρ = ExpandA(ρ) · s₁`; the secret and error/uniform distributions are uniform.

Sampling `ρ` through `ExpandSeed` (rather than uniformly) makes the `ρ` marginal line up *exactly*
with `keygen0` / `keygen1`, so the uniform-branch identity `(H1)` against `keygen1` is a clean
monad-rewriting fact (no distributional assumption: `keygen1` discards the secret, and its `ρ` is
this same `(ExpandSeed seed).1`). What it does **not** reconcile is the *joint* law of `(ρ, s₁, s₂)`
in `keygen0`, where `(s₁, s₂) = ExpandS((ExpandSeed seed).2)` are derived from the *same* seed as
`ρ`, whereas the MLWE problem samples `s₁`/error independently of `ρ`; that joint independence is
the residual honest-sampling gap `(H0)` recorded below and folded into the ROM by the paper.

The matrix never appears as a free challenge: phrasing the MLWE instance over seeds is exactly the
ROM modeling of Dilithium with `ExpandA` a random oracle, and it makes the distinguisher `B` total
(no `ExpandA`-surjectivity assumption). Relating an abstract matrix-based MLWE problem to this
concrete seed-based one is a statement-level bridge obligation. -/

directly from the seed, runs the NMA forging strategy `main` on `pk`, simulates the random oracle
to verify the returned forgery, and outputs the validity bit as its decision.

When `(ρ, t)` is real, `B` reproduces `nmaGame … keygen0`; when `t` is uniform, it reproduces
`nmaGame … keygen1`. Thus `B`'s distinguishing advantage is exactly the NMA-game gap. The seed-based
phrasing means `B` needs no matrix-to-seed embedding. -/

/-- The concrete SelfTargetMSIS problem embedded by ML-DSA verification (Lemma 7, Step 3).

After the key has uniform `t` (`keygen1`), a forgery `(msg, some (w', (z, h)))` accepted by
`verify` is, via the random oracle answer `c̃ = H(msg, w')`, a SelfTargetMSIS solution: the matrix
`Â = ExpandA(ρ)` is the challenge, the public key `pk` is the target, the hash input is `(msg, w')`,
and the response is `(z, h)`. Validity recomputes the commitment from `(pk, c̃, (z, h))` via
`UseHint ∘ computeWApprox` (commitment recoverability) and runs the identification-scheme verifier;
this is precisely the equation `verify` checks, so an accepted forgery maps to a valid STMSIS
solution.

The `sampleParams` draws the same seed-based key as `keygen1`/`mldsaMLWE`: it samples `ρ` through
`ExpandSeed`, a uniform `t`, and publishes `(ExpandA(ρ), pk)` with `pk = ⟨ρ, Power2Round(t).1⟩`. -/

/-- **The SelfTargetMSIS extractor `C` (Lemma 7, Step 3).**

`C` runs the NMA forger `main` on the public key `pk` (the STMSIS target). The forger interacts with
the random oracle `H : (M × Commitment) →ₒ CommitHashBytes`. On a forgery `(msg, some (w', (z, h)))`
`C` outputs the STMSIS preimage `(msg, w')` together with the response `(z, h)`. An aborting forgery
`(msg, none)` is mapped to a dummy preimage with a zeroed response, which the STMSIS RO-consistency
check rejects. The matrix in `params.1` is ignored by `C` (it equals `ExpandA(params.2.ρ)`).

The STMSIS experiment then looks up `c̃ = H(msg, w')` in the oracle cache and checks
`mldsaSTMSIS.isValid Â pk c̃ (z, h)`, which recomputes `w'` from `(pk, c̃, (z, h))` and runs the
identification verifier — exactly what the NMA `verify` does after querying `H(msg, w')`. -/

/-- **Per-key STMSIS read-back comparison.** For a fixed public key `pk`, the NMA forge-and-verify
tail (run through `simulateToProbComp`) accepts no more often than the SelfTargetMSIS experiment
tail of `extractorC` at the matching parameters `(ExpandA(ρ), pk)`.

Both tails first simulate `main pk` against the same random oracle from the empty cache; the proof
compares them after that shared prefix (`probOutput_bind_mono`). On an aborting forgery the NMA tail
is deterministically `false`. On a forgery `some (w', (z, h))` both branches issue the *same*
`H(msg, w')` query on the *same* cache, so the random answer `c̃` and the resulting cache coincide;
the STMSIS experiment then reads `c̃` back and `mldsaSTMSIS.isValid` recovers `w'` as exactly the
`useHintVec …` value that `verify` checks against, so an accepted NMA forgery is a valid STMSIS
solution. -/

/-- **The SelfTargetMSIS extraction bound (Lemma 7, Step 3).** The uniform-`t` EUF-NMA advantage is
bounded by the SelfTargetMSIS advantage of the extractor `C`.

A forgery accepted by the NMA game (after the `H(msg, w')` query inside `verify`) is exactly a valid
SelfTargetMSIS solution for `mldsaSTMSIS`: `C` reproduces the forger's oracle trace, the
experiment's RO-consistency lookup recovers the same `c̃ = H(msg, w')`, `isValid` recovers `w'` and
runs the identical verifier. The reduction to the per-key comparison `stmsis_tail_le` is the
bundled-semantics rewrite (`nmaGame_eq_keygen_bind`) plus monotonicity over the shared `keygen1`
prefix; the per-key step then handles the cache read-back and commitment recoverability. -/

/-! ## Status

The reduction scaffolding is fully proven:

- **MLWE key-swap plumbing.** `advantage_eq_game_boolDistAdvantage` (generic) and
  `nmaGame_eq_keygen_bind` identify each NMA game with the matching single-branch MLWE game, so the
  real-vs-uniform key gap is exactly the advantage of `distinguisherB` against the seed-based
  `mldsaMLWE` problem.
- **STMSIS extraction (`nmaAdvantage_keygen1_le_stmsis`).** The uniform-`t` NMA advantage is bounded
  by the SelfTargetMSIS advantage of `extractorC`; after `nmaGame_eq_keygen_bind` both sides bind
  over the same `keygen1` prefix, so `probOutput_bind_mono` reduces to the per-key lemma
  `stmsis_tail_le`, which couples the single `H(msg, w')` query (the cached answer is read back and
  `verify = true → isValid = true` closes the per-answer inequality).
