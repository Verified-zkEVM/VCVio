# ML-DSA EUF-NMA Security: reduction scaffolding

This file builds the reduction infrastructure for the ML-DSA EUF-NMA analysis:

1. **Exact short-secret MLWE key swap.** `keygenShort` samples `(s₁, s₂)` on the `η`-bounded box
   used by the ML-DSA assumption, while `keygenShort1` replaces `t = Â · s₁ + s₂` by a uniform
   vector. `nma_keyswap_hop_short` identifies their NMA-game gap with the seed-based
   `mldsaMLWEShort` advantage, and `advantage_mldsaMLWEShort_le_matrix` relates that problem to
   uniform-matrix MLWE under an explicit `ExpandA` idealization.
2. **Seed-derived scaffolding.** `keygen0` and `keygen1` describe the concrete seed-derived and
   uniform-`t` key distributions. The generic lemma `nmaGame_eq_keygen_bind` factors either
   key-generator prefix out of the NMA runtime. The older full-ring `mldsaMLWE` definitions remain
   useful scaffolding, but do not identify `keygen0` with a literature MLWE distribution.
3. **SelfTargetMSIS extraction (`nmaAdvantage_keygen1_le_stmsis`).** Once `t` is uniform the key
   carries no secret, so a forgery is a short vector satisfying the *tailored* SelfTargetMSIS
   relation of `mldsaSTMSIS` (see *Tailored vs. standard SelfTargetMSIS* below); the extractor
   `extractorC` reads `(z, c̃)` out of the forged signature. This is fully proven: the
   shared random-oracle simulation lines up the NMA `verify` query with the extractor's RO read-back
   (`stmsis_tail_le`), and an accepted forgery is a valid solution of that problem by commitment
   recoverability.

The `H₁` reprogramming step of the paper folds into the random-oracle modeling and is not separated
out here.

## What is defined here

The honest ML-DSA key distribution embeds an MLWE instance: sample a public seed `ρ`, set the
public matrix `Â = ExpandA(ρ)`, sample short secrets `(s₁, s₂)`, and publish the `Power2Round`
high half of `t = Â · s₁ + s₂`. The uniform-`t` variant replaces `Â · s₁ + s₂` by a uniform
sample. We package both as `ProbComp` key generators, lift each to an EUF-NMA game over an
arbitrary forging adversary `main`, and exhibit the MLWE distinguisher `B` that interpolates
between them: `B (Â, t)` reconstructs the public key from `(ρ, t)` and runs the adversary.

## Modeling note (seeds, not matrices)

The verifier recomputes `Â = ExpandA(pk.ρ)` from the seed stored in the public key, so the MLWE
challenge matrix `Â` must be presented to the adversary *through* a seed `ρ`. Rather than carrying
an embedding witness `ExpandA(ρ) = Â` (which need not exist, since `ExpandA` is not surjective), we
**re-seed-base** the MLWE problem: the public challenge of `mldsaMLWE` is the *seed* `ρ` itself, and
the matrix is *defined* as `Â := ExpandA(ρ)` wherever it is used, so that
`noiseless s₁ ρ = ExpandA(ρ)·s₁`.
This is the standard ROM modeling of Dilithium with `ExpandA` a random oracle, and it makes the
distinguisher `B` total: it consumes `(ρ, t)` and forms `pk = (ρ, Power2Round(t).1)` directly with
no embedding witness required.

## Tailored vs. standard SelfTargetMSIS

The problems `mldsaSTMSIS` and `mldsaSTMSISShort` are **tailored** SelfTargetMSIS problems: their
validity predicate *is* the ML-DSA verifier relation, namely the norm gates `‖z‖∞ < γ₁ − β` and
`weight(h) ≤ ω`, the hint-recovered equation
`w' = UseHint(h, Â·z − SampleInBall(c̃)·(t₁·2^d))` over `R_q`, and the self-target binding
`hashInput.2 = w'` (with the RO consistency of `c̃` supplied by the surrounding
`SelfTargetMSIS.experiment`). What is proved here is the extraction into that tailored problem
together with its algebraic characterization (`stmsisAlgebraicSolution`,
`mldsaSTMSISShort_isValid_iff`, `mldsaSTMSISShort_isValid_expandA_iff`).

This is deliberately *not* the standard SelfTargetMSIS normal form used in the literature, which
states the linear relation as `[I_m | A] · y` with the challenge occupying the final coefficient
block of the short preimage `y`. Reducing the tailored relation to that normal form — absorbing
`UseHint` and the `2^d` shift into a single short vector — is follow-up work, and no declaration
in this file claims it.

The FIPS key generator derives everything deterministically from one seed
(`keygen0` above). The idealized proof-level model instead samples the matrix
seed `ρ`, the signing key `K`, and the short secrets `(s₁, s₂)` independently,
with `(s₁, s₂)` uniform on the `η`-bounded box `S_η^ℓ × S_η^k` — the
distribution the Module-LWE assumption for ML-DSA is stated over. The key-swap
hop is then an exact monad identity against `mldsaMLWEShort` (no statistical
slack); the deterministic-XOF derivation is not part of this hop and is handled
separately by a named XOF-replacement assumption. -/

`(ρ, ρ', K)` and derive `(s₁, s₂) = ExpandS(ρ')` — from independent sampling with the
correct short marginals: `ρ`, `K` uniform and `(s₁, s₂)` uniform on the `η`-bounded box
`S_η^ℓ × S_η^k`, i.e. exactly the draws of the idealized key generator `keygenShort`.

This is the standard PRG/XOF-replacement reading of `ExpandSeed`/`ExpandS` against the
short-secret marginal: the ideal branch is the box distribution the Module-LWE assumption
for ML-DSA is stated over, so the assumption carries exactly the "SHAKE output is
pseudorandom with the FIPS marginals" step and nothing else. For a fixed deterministic
`prims` the unrestricted-quantifier form is only satisfiable at large `εPRG` — an unbounded
distinguisher can test membership in the `2^256`-point image of the seed expansion — so,
pending the cost-model infrastructure (#460), it should be read computationally, against
bounded distinguishers, where it is the assumption that the SHAKE-derived `(ρ, K, s₁, s₂)`
is pseudorandom with the FIPS marginals. It is consumed by the FIPS-keygen corollary
`nma_security_fips` to transfer the short-model bound to `keygen0`. -/

/-- The concrete MLWE problem embedded by ML-DSA key generation, **seed-based**: the public
challenge is the public matrix seed `ρ = (ExpandSeed(seed)).1` for a uniform `seed`, the secret is
`s₁`, and the output is `t`. The matrix is recovered on demand as `Â := ExpandA(ρ)`, so
`noiseless s₁ ρ = ExpandA(ρ) · s₁`; the secret and error/uniform distributions are uniform.

Sampling `ρ` through `ExpandSeed` (rather than uniformly) makes the `ρ` marginal line up exactly
with `keygen0` / `keygen1`, so the uniform branch against `keygen1` is a clean monad-rewriting
fact. The real branch is intentionally not identified with `keygen0`: here `s₁` and the error are
independent uniform elements of the full ring, whereas `keygen0` derives `η`-bounded vectors from
the same seed as `ρ`. No random-oracle assumption turns those distributions into one another.
The short-secret problem `mldsaMLWEShort` below is the literature-facing formulation used by the
proved key-swap theorem.

The matrix never appears as a free challenge: phrasing the MLWE instance over seeds is exactly the
ROM modeling of Dilithium with `ExpandA` a random oracle, and it makes the distinguisher `B` total
(no `ExpandA`-surjectivity assumption). Relating an abstract matrix-based MLWE problem to this
concrete seed-based one is a statement-level bridge obligation. -/

directly from the seed, runs the NMA forging strategy `main` on `pk`, simulates the random oracle
to verify the returned forgery, and outputs the validity bit as its decision.

The uniform branch reproduces `nmaGame … keygen1`. The full-ring real branch does **not**
reproduce `keygen0`: this problem samples `s₁` and `s₂` independently and uniformly over the
entire ring, whereas `keygen0` derives `η`-bounded secrets from the same seed as `ρ`. Accordingly,
this definition is retained as seed-based reduction scaffolding rather than a proved key-swap hop.

/-! ### Short-secret MLWE problems and the seed-to-matrix bridge

The idealized short-key model states its Module-LWE assumption over short `(s₁, s₂)`
(`mldsaMLWEShort`, seed-based; `mldsaMatrixMLWE`, uniform-matrix form). The seed-based problem
reduces to the standard matrix form under the `expandAIdealization` XOF assumption
(`advantage_mldsaMLWEShort_le_matrix`), and `distinguisherBShort` is the induced distinguisher
whose advantage the short key-swap hop bounds. -/

/-- **The short-secret Module-LWE problem for ML-DSA** (seed-based form). The public
challenge is the matrix seed `ρ` itself (uniform), the secret `s₁` and the additive
error `s₂` are uniform on the `η`-bounded box (`sampleShortVec`), and the decision
target is `t = ExpandA(ρ) · s₁ + s₂` versus uniform `t`. This is the distribution the
ML-DSA literature states its MLWE assumption over; unlike a uniform-error variant it
is not information-theoretically trivial, since `ExpandA(ρ) · s₁ + s₂` with short
`(s₁, s₂)` is far from uniform. Bridging the seed-based challenge to the standard
uniform-matrix form is `advantage_mldsaMLWEShort_le_matrix`, under the explicit
`expandAIdealization` assumption. -/

public challenge is a uniform matrix `A`, the secret and error are uniform on the
`η`-bounded box, and the decision target is `A · s₁ + s₂` versus uniform. This is the
literature-facing hardness assumption; `mldsaMLWEShort` reduces to it under

/-- **ExpandA idealization (quantified XOF-as-random-matrix step).** For every
distinguisher `D` receiving both the seed and the matrix, the pair
`(ρ, ExpandA(ρ))` for uniform `ρ` is `εA`-indistinguishable from `(ρ, A)` with `A`
uniform and independent of `ρ`.

This is the standard random-oracle reading of `ExpandA` (Dilithium's `A = ExpandA(ρ)`
with `ExpandA` modeled as a random function), stated once with inspectable content
rather than supplied per-reduction. For a fixed deterministic `prims.expandA` the
unrestricted-quantifier form is only satisfiable at large `εA` (a distinguisher may
recompute `ExpandA(ρ)` and compare); pending the cost-model infrastructure (#460) it
should be read computationally, against bounded distinguishers, where it is the
assumption that SHAKE-based expansion yields a pseudorandom matrix. -/

seed-based short problem yields one against the standard uniform-matrix problem: the
matrix adversary runs the seed adversary on a freshly sampled seed and the challenged

/-- The concrete SelfTargetMSIS problem embedded by ML-DSA verification (Lemma 7, Step 3).

After the key has uniform `t` (`keygen1`), a forgery `(msg, some (w', (z, h)))` accepted by
`verify` is, via the random oracle answer `c̃ = H(msg, w')`, a SelfTargetMSIS solution: the matrix
`Â = ExpandA(ρ)` is the challenge, the public key `pk` is the target, the hash input is `(msg, w')`,
and the response is `(z, h)`. Validity recomputes the commitment from `(pk, c̃, (z, h))` via
`UseHint ∘ computeWApprox` (commitment recoverability) and runs the identification-scheme verifier;
this is precisely the equation `verify` checks, so an accepted forgery maps to a valid STMSIS
solution.

The `sampleParams` draws the same seed-based key as `keygen1`/`mldsaMLWE`: it samples `ρ` through
`ExpandSeed`, a uniform `t`, and publishes `(ExpandA(ρ), pk)` with `pk = ⟨ρ, Power2Round(t).1⟩`. -/

/-- **The SelfTargetMSIS extractor `C` (Lemma 7, Step 3).**

`C` runs the NMA forger `main` on the public key `pk` (the STMSIS target). The forger interacts with
the random oracle `H : (M × Commitment) →ₒ CommitHashBytes`. On a forgery `(msg, some (w', (z, h)))`
`C` outputs the STMSIS preimage `(msg, w')` together with the response `(z, h)`. An aborting forgery
`(msg, none)` is mapped to a dummy preimage with a zeroed response; the STMSIS experiment then reads
back `H(msg, default)`, which the forger may well have queried. That costs nothing: the NMA tail is
deterministically `false` on an abort, and the reduction's target is an upper bound on the NMA side,
so extra successes on the STMSIS side only add slack in the favorable direction. The matrix in
`params.1` is ignored by `C` (it equals `ExpandA(params.2.ρ)`).

The STMSIS experiment then looks up `c̃ = H(msg, w')` in the oracle cache and checks
`mldsaSTMSIS.isValid Â pk c̃ (z, h)`, which recomputes `w'` from `(pk, c̃, (z, h))` and runs the
identification verifier — exactly what the NMA `verify` does after querying `H(msg, w')`. -/

Both tails first simulate `main pk` against the same random oracle from the empty cache; the proof
compares them after that shared prefix (`probOutput_bind_mono`). On an aborting forgery the NMA tail
is deterministically `false`. On a forgery `some (w', (z, h))` both branches issue the *same*
`H(msg, w')` query on the *same* cache, so the random answer `c̃` and the resulting cache coincide;
the STMSIS experiment then reads `c̃` back and `mldsaSTMSIS.isValid` recovers `w'` as exactly the
`useHintVec …` value that `verify` checks against, so an accepted NMA forgery is a valid STMSIS

/-! ### Tailored SelfTargetMSIS leg in the idealized short-key model

The declarations below add the short-model counterpart of the SelfTargetMSIS extraction:
the tailored problem `mldsaSTMSISShort` (self-target binding + the short-scheme verifier), its
algebraic characterization lemmas, the extractor `extractorCShort`, and the NMA-to-STMSIS
extraction bound `nmaAdvantage_keygenShort1_le_stmsis`. They reuse the shared extractor
`extractorC` and the seed-based helpers from the enclosing section. -/

/-- **The SelfTargetMSIS problem embedded by ML-DSA verification in the idealized short-key
model.** The validity predicate recovers the
commitment `w'` from `(pk, c̃, (z, h))` via `UseHint ∘ computeWApprox`, requires it to equal
the commitment component of the hash preimage (the self-target binding), and runs the
identification-scheme verifier (the short-scheme constant `identificationSchemeShort`),
and the parameters are sampled from the idealized
uniform-`t` key generator `keygenShort1`: the matrix seed `ρ`, the signing key `K`, and the
short secrets are drawn independently, `t` is uniform, and the published pair is
`(ExpandA(ρ), pk)` with `pk = ⟨ρ, Power2Round(t).1⟩`. This is the STMSIS instance matching the
exact short-model key-swap hop (`nma_keyswap_hop_short`).

Accepted solutions are characterized algebraically by `stmsisAlgebraicSolution` via the
bridge `mldsaSTMSISShort_isValid_iff`: the verifier's norm gates `‖z‖∞ < γ₁ − β` and
`weight(h) ≤ ω`, the hint-recovered matrix equation
`w' = UseHint(h, Â·z − SampleInBall(c̃)·(t₁·2^d))` over `R_q`, and the self-target binding
`hashInput.2 = w'` tying the recovered commitment to the pair hashed to produce `c̃`, whose
RO consistency is enforced by the surrounding `SelfTargetMSIS.experiment`. At the matched
parameters published by `sampleParams` acceptance is the norm gates plus the binding
(`mldsaSTMSISShort_isValid_expandA_iff`). The relation is the tailored verifier relation, not
the standard SelfTargetMSIS normal form `[I_m | A] · y` with the challenge in the final
coefficient block of `y`; reducing the tailored relation to that normal form is follow-up
work. -/

`mldsaSTMSISShort.isValid` is defined through the identification-scheme verifier plus the
self-target binding. The declarations below re-express an accepted solution in explicit
algebraic form — the norm gates, the hint-recovered matrix equation over `R_q`, and the
binding of the recovered commitment to the hashed preimage. That algebraic form is the
endpoint reached here: it is the tailored verifier relation, and reducing it to the standard
SelfTargetMSIS normal form `[I_m | A] · y` (challenge in the final coefficient block of the

/-- **The explicit algebraic SelfTargetMSIS relation extracted from `mldsaSTMSISShort`.**
Writing `c = SampleInBall(c̃)` and `t₁·2^d = power2RoundShiftVec t₁`, a solution `(z, h)`
for an instance matrix `Â` and target `pk = (ρ, t₁)` consists of:

1. the verifier's **norm gates**, verbatim: `‖z‖∞ < γ₁ − β` and `weight(h) ≤ ω`;
2. the **matrix equation**: a commitment `w'` recovered from the hint,
   `w' = UseHint(h, Â·z − c·(t₁·2^d))` over `R_q` (the coefficient-domain reading of
   `computeWApprox`, see `computeWApprox_eq_mul_sub_smul`), which the verifier's own
   recomputation from the published seed reproduces:
   `UseHint(h, ExpandA(ρ)·z − c·(t₁·2^d)) = w'`;
3. the **self-target binding**: the commitment component of the hash preimage equals the
   recovered commitment, `hashInput.2 = w'` — the solution is bound to the very pair hashed
   to produce `c̃`.

The **RO-consistency** of `c̃` is deliberately not part of the relation: it is enforced by
the surrounding `SelfTargetMSIS.experiment` (cache read-back), not by `isValid`. The
relation quantifies nothing `isValid` does not check — it is a re-expression of
`mldsaSTMSISShort.isValid` (`mldsaSTMSISShort_isValid_iff`), not a strengthening; on the
matched parameters `Â = ExpandA(ρ)` published by `sampleParams` the two sides of the
recovered-commitment equation coincide and acceptance is the norm gates plus the binding

/-- **NMA security of ML-DSA in the idealized short-key model (Lemma 7, CRYPTO 2023).**

For every EUF-NMA adversary `A` against the ML-DSA scheme (instantiated via `FiatShamirWithAbort`
over the idealized short-secret key generation `keygenShort`), there exist an MLWE adversary `B`
and a SelfTargetMSIS adversary `C` such that

  `Adv^{EUF-NMA}(A) ≤ Adv^{MLWE}(B) + Adv^{SelfTargetMSIS}(C)`.

The reductions are the concrete ones built in this file: the key-swap distinguisher
`distinguisherBShort`, whose `mldsaMLWEShort` advantage **equals** the real-vs-uniform key gap —
the short key-swap hop `nma_keyswap_hop_short` is an exact monad identity, so no statistical
slack term appears in the bound — and the SelfTargetMSIS extractor `extractorCShort`, which
turns a uniform-`t` forgery into a short self-target solution
(`nmaAdvantage_keygenShort1_le_stmsis`).

The hypothesis `hMlweBridge` supplies, for every forging strategy, an abstract MLWE adversary at
a bridge slack `εbridge`. Its canonical discharge lands on the uniform-matrix problem: take
`mlwe := mldsaMatrixMLWE p`, `εbridge := εA`, and for each `main` the witness
`matrixLift p prims (distinguisherBShort p prims hr maxAttempts main)` with the proven reduction
`advantage_mldsaMLWEShort_le_matrix` under the `expandAIdealization εA` assumption.

Concretely, it supplies for every forging strategy an abstract MLWE adversary at
least as good (up to `εbridge`) as `distinguisherBShort` against the seed-based short problem
`mldsaMLWEShort` — the
distribution the ML-DSA Module-LWE assumption is stated over (secrets uniform on the `η`-bounded
box). Under `expandAIdealization` the bridge can be instantiated against the standard
uniform-matrix problem `mldsaMatrixMLWE` via `advantage_mldsaMLWEShort_le_matrix`. The
SelfTargetMSIS side has matching types, so `hStmsis` is a plain equality
`stmsis = mldsaSTMSISShort p prims M`, and `hGen : hr.gen = keygenShort p prims` pins the
Fiat-Shamir key generation to the idealized short-key generator. The relation of `hr` is the
material-based `validKeyPairShort`, which `keygenShort` genuinely generates: the pair
`(hr, hGen)` is inhabited by `hrShort` (`keygenShort_generable`), so the statement has
non-vacuous instances.

This is the EUF-NMA half (Lemma 7) of the ML-DSA security proof in the idealized short-key model;
the CMA-to-NMA statistical step (`euf_cma_security_of_nma_short`) composes on top of it. -/

/-- **NMA security of ML-DSA at the FIPS seed-derived key generation.**

The short-model bound `nma_security_short` transferred to the deterministic FIPS key
generator `keygen0` through the XOF-replacement assumption `expandSReplacement`: for every
EUF-NMA adversary against the ML-DSA scheme instantiated with the seed-derived key relation
(`hGen : hr.gen = keygen0 p prims`, inhabited by `hrFips` / `keygen0_generable`), there are
an MLWE adversary and a SelfTargetMSIS adversary with

  `Adv^{EUF-NMA}(A) ≤ (Adv^{MLWE}(B) + εbridge) + Adv^{SelfTargetMSIS}(C) + εPRG`.

The proof has exactly one new ingredient beyond the short model: the FIPS and short NMA
games share their forge-and-verify tail (`identificationScheme` and
`identificationSchemeShort` carry the same `verify` function), so the gap between the
`keygen0` game and the `keygenShort` game is one application of `hPRG` at the distinguisher
`D ρ K s₁ s₂ :=` "run the tail at the key built by `keyFromMaterial` from the material
`(ρ, K, s₁, s₂)`": its real branch is exactly the FIPS game and its ideal branch is exactly
the short game. The short-model reduction hypotheses (`hrS`/`hGenS`, `hStmsis`,
`hMlweBridge`) then bound the short game as in `nma_security_short`, applied to the same
forging strategy repackaged at the short scheme tag. -/

/-- **EUF-CMA security of the commitment-carrying short-key ML-DSA signature.**

The CMA-to-NMA-to-hardness composition over the idealized short-secret key generation
`keygenShort`: for any EUF-CMA adversary `adv` against the Fiat-Shamir-with-aborts ML-DSA
signature, the advantage is bounded by the MLWE advantage, the SelfTargetMSIS advantage, and the
statistical CMA-to-NMA loss `FiatShamirWithAbort.cmaToNmaLoss`. The proof composes three pieces:

1. `FiatShamirWithAbort.euf_cma_to_nma`: `adv.advantage ≤ Pr[managedRoNmaExp simulatedNmaAdv]
   + cmaToNmaLoss`, under the good-key/commitment-guessing/abort/query hypotheses;
2. `FiatShamirWithAbort.managedRoNmaExp_simulatedNmaAdv_eq_eufNmaExp` (Option B): the managed-RO
   NMA success probability equals the plain EUF-NMA advantage of `simulatedEufNmaAdv`, the
   cache-forgetting reduction;
3. `nma_security_short` (Lemma 7, short model) applied to `simulatedEufNmaAdv`:
   `≤ MLWE + SelfTargetMSIS`, with no statistical key-swap slack — the short-model hop is exact.

The loss parameters carry the nonnegativity and good-key hypotheses that the abstract reduction
needs; the bridge hypotheses (`hGen`, `hStmsis`, `hMlweBridge`) pin the abstract hardness problems
to the concrete short-model ML-DSA ones (`keygenShort`, `mldsaSTMSISShort`, `mldsaMLWEShort`).
The relation of `hr` is the material-based `validKeyPairShort`, so `hGen` is inhabited by
`hrShort` (`keygenShort_generable`). The HVZK obligation `hhvzk` stays abstract: in the short
model the withheld key part `t₀` is not determined by the public key across material-valid
pairs, so no single simulator is exact-on-accept for every valid pair; the hypothesis is
satisfiable (any simulator at `ζ_zk = 1`, since `tvDist ≤ 1`), and a quantitative discharge
needs a bound accounting for the hint mismatch across colliding keys.

**Scope: commitment-carrying, not yet the end-to-end FIPS CMA headline.** This theorem is
stated for the standard Fiat-Shamir-with-aborts signature whose commitment is *carried* in the
signature (the generic `Option (Commitment × Response)` type). FIPS-204 ML-DSA instead
*recovers* the commitment at verification rather than carrying it; reaching that form via
commitment recovery costs one extra hash query per signing query, so the end-to-end loss grows
by `qS` to `qH + qS` — the distinction recorded in `FiatShamirWithAbort.cmaToNmaLoss`. Supplying
that commitment-recovery bridge, and composing it with the FIPS seed-derived key generation, is
follow-up work: `nma_security_fips` currently gives the seed-derived-key result at the NMA level
only. -/

/-! ## Asymptotic (negligible) EUF-CMA headline

The non-degenerate asymptotic statement. The scheme is indexed by a security parameter `n`
through a *family* `(p n, prims n)` of ML-DSA parameter/primitive instances, so that the
commitment guessing probability `ε n`, the key-regularity failure `δ n`, the HVZK slack
`ζ_zk n`, and the MLWE-bridge slack `εbridge n` all shrink (negligibly) as `n → ∞` while the
signing / hashing query budgets `qS n`, `qH n` grow only polynomially in `n`. Under negligible
MLWE and SelfTargetMSIS advantage families this makes the EUF-CMA advantage family negligible.

A fixed-scheme wrapper would be degenerate: with a *constant* `ε > 0` the loss term
`2·qS·(qH+1)·ε/(1−p)` is only negligible when the query budgets vanish. Here the slacks are
themselves negligible families, so each loss term is `poly(n) · negligible(n)`, which is negligible
by `negligible_polynomial_mul`. -/

/-- **Asymptotic (negligible) EUF-CMA security of ML-DSA in the idealized short-key model.**

The security-parameter-indexed, non-degenerate headline. The ML-DSA scheme is given as a
*family* `(p n, prims n)` over the security parameter `n`, with all carrier instances
supplied per `n`. The hypotheses are the `n`-indexed lifts of those of
`euf_cma_security_of_nma_short`, plus:

* polynomial query bounds `qS n ≤ pS.eval n`, `qH n ≤ pH.eval n`;
* negligible commitment-guessing slack `ε`, key-regularity slack `δ`, HVZK slack `ζ_zk`,
  and MLWE-bridge slack `εbridge` families (the commitment / response spaces grow with `n`);
* negligible MLWE and SelfTargetMSIS advantage families `mlweAdv`, `stmsisAdv` dominating
  every reduction adversary (the hardness assumptions, carried as `n`-indexed families per
  the standard ROM model).

The conclusion is that the EUF-CMA advantage family of `adv` is negligible. The proof
instantiates the per-`n` bound `euf_cma_security_of_nma_short`, dominates the two existential
reductions by their negligible families, and bounds the statistical loss family with
`cmaToNmaLoss_negligible`: with polynomially-bounded queries and negligible slacks each loss
term is `poly(n) · negligible(n)`.

No cost model is attached: the statement quantifies over unrestricted adversaries and
`n`-indexed advantage families, not over poly-time adversaries (see the scope note in the
module docstring). The numerical regime is jointly satisfiable with genuinely growing query
budgets (`asymptotic_loss_regime_satisfiable`). -/

/-- **Consistency of the asymptotic numerical-loss regime.**

The quantitative hypotheses of `euf_cma_security_asymptotic_short` — *polynomially-bounded*
query budgets together with *negligible* statistical slacks (commitment guessing `ε`, HVZK
`ζ_zk`, key regularity `δ`, MLWE bridge `εbridge`) and negligible hardness advantage families
— are jointly satisfiable with query budgets that genuinely **grow** with the security
parameter. Concretely, taking `qS n = qH n = n` (bounded by `Polynomial.X`, i.e. *not*
vanishing), all slacks and advantage families equal to `(1 / 2) ^ n`, and `p_abort = 1 / 2`,
the resulting `cmaToNmaLoss` family, together with the two hardness families and the bridge
slack, is negligible — so the dominating sum in the headline's internal bound is negligible.

This rules out the degenerate reading of the headline (where polynomial queries against a
*fixed* positive `ε` would force the budgets to vanish): here the budgets grow polynomially
while the loss still decays.

This statement chooses **numerical sequences only**. It does not instantiate the hardness
problems, `hMlweBridge`, the HVZK simulator family, the scheme family, or the other
hypotheses of `euf_cma_security_asymptotic_short`; it describes the loss regime, not the
satisfiability of the security theorem. -/

/-! ## Status

The live short-secret reduction and the extraction bound are fully proven:

- **MLWE key swap (`nma_keyswap_hop_short`).** The exact NMA-game gap for
  `keygenShort` / `keygenShort1` is the advantage of `distinguisherBShort` against
  `mldsaMLWEShort`. `advantage_mldsaMLWEShort_le_matrix` supplies the explicit seed-to-matrix
  bridge. The older `mldsaMLWE` / `distinguisherB` declarations are scaffolding only: their
  full-ring real branch is not the seed-derived `keygen0` distribution.
- **STMSIS extraction (`nmaAdvantage_keygen1_le_stmsis`).** The uniform-`t` NMA advantage is bounded
  by the SelfTargetMSIS advantage of `extractorC`; after `nmaGame_eq_keygen_bind` both sides bind
  over the same `keygen1` prefix, so `probOutput_bind_mono` reduces to the per-key lemma
  `stmsis_tail_le`, which couples the single `H(msg, w')` query (the cached answer is read back and
  `verify = true → isValid = true` closes the per-answer inequality).

/-- **The matrix-MLWE-facing NMA headline.** `nma_security_short` with the abstract-problem
bridge discharged: the MLWE leg lands on the standard uniform-matrix short-secret problem
`mldsaMatrixMLWE`, at the cost of one application of the `expandAIdealization` assumption
(`advantage_mldsaMLWEShort_le_matrix`, supplying the bridge slack `εA`). The SelfTargetMSIS leg
still lands on the *tailored* `mldsaSTMSISShort`, not the standard SelfTargetMSIS normal form —
that second bridge is follow-up work, so only the MLWE side is stated against a standard
literature problem here. No caller-supplied inequality remains: every hypothesis is a
satisfiable pinned equality (`keygenShort_generable`), a proven reduction, or the named XOF
idealization. -/
