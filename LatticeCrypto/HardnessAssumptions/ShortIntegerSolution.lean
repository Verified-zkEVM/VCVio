# Short Integer Solution (SIS) and SelfTargetMSIS

This file defines the Short Integer Solution (SIS) problem and its variant SelfTargetMSIS
(Self-Target Module-SIS), which is used in the security proof of ML-DSA (CRYSTALS-Dilithium).

## SIS

The (Module-)SIS problem: given a uniformly random matrix `A`, find a short nonzero vector `x`
such that `Ax = 0`. The generic interface covers both ordinary SIS over `ZMod p` and module-SIS
over a finite coefficient ring.

## SelfTargetMSIS

The SelfTargetMSIS problem (introduced in the Dilithium security proof): given a random matrix
`A` and access to a random oracle `H`, find a hash preimage `(μ, w)` and a short response `z`
such that `c = H(μ, w)` and `Az = c*t + w'` where the recomputed commitment `w'` matches `w`.
The "self-target" is this binding of the solution to its own hash preimage: `isValid` receives
the preimage alongside the RO output `c`, and an instantiation must require the commitment it
recomputes from the response to equal the commitment component `w` of the hashed preimage. The
experiment enforces the RO side of the binding by looking the preimage up in the oracle's
query cache.

namespace SelfTargetMSIS

/-- The SelfTargetMSIS problem for lattice-based signatures.

The adversary receives a matrix `A` and a target vector `t`, and has access to a random
oracle `H`. The adversary must produce `(hashInput, response)` such that:
1. `c = H(hashInput)` (RO consistency: the adversary must have queried the RO on `hashInput`)
2. `isValid(challenge, target, hashInput, c, response)` holds (shortness bound + verification
   equation binding the recomputed commitment to `hashInput`'s commitment component)

The experiment enforces RO consistency by looking up `hashInput` in the RO's query cache.
If the adversary never queried `H(hashInput)`, the check fails automatically.

This captures the core hardness assumption in the ML-DSA/Dilithium security proof. -/

  /-- Check whether a purported solution is valid, given the hash preimage the adversary
  queried and the hash output the RO cached for it. Receiving the preimage is what makes the
  problem *self-targeting*: an instantiation must require the commitment recomputed from the
  response to equal the commitment component of the hashed preimage, binding the solution to
  the very input hashed to produce the challenge. -/
