# SLH-DSA scheme witness dispatch canaries

Executable checks that a verifying SLH-DSA signature routes into the *right arm* of the composite
witness type, and that the witness it yields there attacks honest key material computed at the
position the signature's own digest names — evaluated at the values, not restated from the theorems.

No collision is exhibitable under an approved instantiation, so the canaries run over a toy
primitive bundle whose `Thash` folds its input with a two-bit shift and drops the low bit of every
child, then exclusive-ors a tweak derived from the whole address and the public seed.

## Why the bundle is new rather than inherited

The bundle the hypertree canaries of this lane use cannot serve here, and the reason is the point of
this fixture.  Its `H_msg` and its `PRF_msg` are both constant and its public seed is a unit, so a
dispatch canary built on it would be inert: every message would produce one digest, every digest
would name one FORS instance and one layer-zero position, and no re-evaluation at "another site"
would move anything.  This bundle's `H_msg` reads all four of its FIPS inputs — the randomizer, the
public seed, the published root and the message — and its `PRF_msg` reads the per-signature
`addrnd`; `checkToyBundle` moves each of those six inputs on its own and requires the digest or the
randomizer to move with it.  The public seed is a byte rather than a unit, so it is load-bearing in
`H_msg`, in the secret map and in every tweak.

The profile is `k = 2` and `d = 2`, which is what makes the two FORS trees and the two hypertree
layers separable: with one FORS tree the global leaf index and the local one coincide, and with one
layer there is no other layer to re-evaluate a witness at.

The toy `H_msg` reads the message only through the exclusive-or of its bytes.  That is a deliberate
weakness: it is what lets the fixture exhibit a signature that verifies for a message the signer
never signed, which is the situation the dispatch exists for, in a bundle with no collision
resistance to appeal to.

## The two forgery sites

Two digests, at two different bottom positions with two different FORS messages, each named by one
signature's own randomizer.  Site A is layer-zero tree one, leaf three; site B is tree two, leaf
zero.  Every honest value either arm attacks therefore differs between them, and every extraction
canary re-evaluates its witness at the other site and requires that to fail.

## The signatures, and which arm each takes

* **A** is the honest signature on site A's message.  Its recovered FORS public key is the honest
  one, so it takes the FORS arm, and the extractor returns the `F`-preimage of the honest leaf image
  at the caller's chosen tree.  The same signature is offered against a second message with the same
  byte fold: the digest, the verification outcome and the extracted witness all agree, which pins
  that the dispatch reads the message only through `H_msg`.
* **D** carries a FORS half whose tree-zero revealed value moves that tree's *leaf image* but not
  the recovered public key — the toy hashes drop the moved bit twice over.  It still takes the FORS
  arm, and the extractor returns the `H`-collision the move creates instead.
* **T** carries a FORS half whose tree-zero authentication node moves that tree's *recovered root*
  but not the recovered public key — the toy `T_k` discards two of the first root's bits, and the
  move lands in one of them.  It still takes the FORS arm, and the extractor returns the `T_k`
  second preimage the move creates.
* **B** carries a FORS half whose recovered public key does move, under an honest hypertree
  signature on that recovered value.  It takes the hypertree arm and diverges at layer zero.
* **C** carries the same FORS half, a perturbed layer-zero component whose recovered root misses
  layer zero's honest root, and an honest top-layer signature on the root that component does
  recover.  It takes the hypertree arm and diverges at layer one.
* **E** carries the same FORS half under the hypertree signature on the *honest* FORS public key.
  It verifies all the same, and the extractor returns an XMSS `H`-collision at layer one rather than
  a WOTS+ witness, which is the branch whose assertion set differs.
* **N** perturbs the top-layer component as well, so no layer's recovered root is that layer's
  honest root.  It does not verify and the extractor returns nothing.

`sigD` and `sigE` share a randomizer and a message, hence a digest, an instance address and every
honest value; they differ only in their FORS halves, and they take different arms.  That pair is
what pins that the arm is decided by the FORS public-key comparison and by nothing else.

## What `Witness.Valid` cannot see, and what is checked instead

`Witness.Valid` reads the signature only through the digest its randomizer produces.  A FORS witness
extracted from `sigD` therefore *does* satisfy `Witness.Valid` against `sigE`, and
`checkArmSelection` asserts that it holds rather than pretending it should not: the arm selection is
a property of `findWitness`, not of the predicate.  What the canaries falsify about the predicate
is the *arguments* each arm is evaluated at — the FORS instance address and FORS message for one
arm, the position and honest running message for the other — by re-evaluating each witness at the
other site, at the other layer, and at the message the forged signature actually carries there.
That last one is the naive identification the fixture is designed to defeat: it is what a reader
reaches for who takes the honest partner off the signature instead of computing it from the secret
seed, and it is required to fail.

Two re-evaluations at this fixture are inert, and both are asserted to hold rather than passed over.
For one of them the reason is asserted alongside; for the other it is a type-level fact and is only
stated.  Moving a WOTS+ `F`-preimage witness's honest running message to the other layer's does not
discriminate, because that branch reads the honest message only through the WOTS+ step count at the
extracted chain and the two layers' honest messages give the same count there; the canary asserts
that equality next to it, and asserts that the naive message's count differs.  An XMSS
`H`-collision witness never reads the honest running message at all.

## The other canaries

`checkToyBundle` is the fixture's own liveness and the agreement of every hand-written table with
the library's computation of it: the four positions, the two honest-running-message tables, the
global FORS leaf index, and the four honest values the re-evaluations recompute.  The global FORS
leaf addresses are additionally matched against a table of `Adrs` records written out by hand, so a
change in how the global index reaches the address is caught there rather than only through
`forsSigLeafIndex`.

`checkSchemeEquations` evaluates the three equations this pull request adds to
`SLHDSA.GeneralScheme` — the key-generation one once, the two verification ones at every signature
the fixture builds — and pins the secret key the first of them does not state.
`checkHonestPartner` pins that the honest layer-zero partner depends on the digest's *position* and
not on its FORS message, which is what makes the hypertree arm's honest starting message well
defined for a message the signer never signed.  `checkFabricated` is the tally: four hand-built
witnesses accepted and eleven rejected, the rejected ones covering both sites, both layer
relabellings, both FORS height bounds, a wrong preimage value, a `T_k` "second preimage" of the
honest root vector itself, and a root vector that does differ from the honest one but does not
compress to it.  There is no out-of-range layer fabrication, and there cannot be one:
`HypertreeWitness.layer` is a `Fin toyParams.d`, so a label at or beyond `d` does not elaborate.

The `example`s pin the library statements at this bundle — the three new `GeneralScheme` equations,
the digest split, the dispatch, both shape equations, both unfolding equations, soundness,
completeness, the three ledger bridges, the three the hypertree arm does not need, three
encoded-distinctness bridges under the SHA-2 and SHAKE encoders, and all seven of the lane's
`_eval` bridges reached through the composite predicate.

/-! ## The signatures

Seven in all.  Six verify against the honest public key: three route to the FORS arm, one to each of
that arm's three constructors, and three to the hypertree arm, which split between the two layers.
The seventh does not verify at site B against the honest public key, and its extractor returns
`none`. -/

/-- **Forgery A**, the honest signature on `msgA`.  Its recovered FORS public key is the honest one,
so it routes to the FORS arm; the toy `H_msg` reads the message only through the exclusive-or of its
bytes, so the same signature verifies for `msgA'` as well, which is what makes a routed forgery on
an unsigned message exhibitable in a fixture with no collision resistance. -/
def sigA : GeneralScheme.SignatureCore toy toyPrimitives.core :=
  GeneralScheme.signInternal toy toyPrimitives msgA secretKey (node addrndA)

/-- The honest FORS signature at site B, which the two hypertree forgeries perturb. -/

/-- The honest FORS public key at site B's instance address. -/
def honestForsPkB : toyPrimitives.Y := forsPkGen toyPrimitives skSeed pkSeed partsB.forsAdrs

/-- A FORS signature whose tree-zero revealed value moves the tree-zero *leaf image* but not the
recovered public key: the toy `F` drops the low bit of its input, and the toy `H` then drops the low
bit of each child, so the perturbed leaf climbs to the same tree-zero root.  A signature carrying
this still routes to the FORS arm. -/
def collapsedFors : ForsSigCore toyParams toyPrimitives.core :=
  honestForsB.set 0 { honestForsB[0] with sk := node (byteOf honestForsB[0].sk + 2) }

/-- A FORS signature whose recovered *root vector* differs from the honest one while its `T_k`
compression agrees, so the recovered public key does not move.  The toy `T_k` folds its children as
`acc ↦ (acc <<< 2) ^^^ (y >>> 1)`, so at `k = 2` the first root reaches the compression through bits
one to six only: its low bit is dropped by the shift right and its high bit is shifted out again by
the shift left.  Moving tree zero's authentication node by `0x40` moves tree zero's recovered root
by `0x80`, which is one of those two.  A signature carrying this still routes to the FORS arm, where
the moved vector is the `T_k` second preimage the extractor returns.  A brute-force sweep over the
one-byte moves of `honestForsB` finds ten such halves; this is one of them. -/

/-! ## The bundle behaves as advertised -/

def forsLeafAdrsTable (j : ℕ) : Adrs := ⟨0, 2, AddrType.forsTree.toCode, 0, 0, j⟩

/-- Sixteen fixture properties.

The first six are the liveness of the two message-derived maps, which the previous fixture in this
lane could not exercise: its `H_msg` and `PRF_msg` were both constant and its public seed was a
unit.  Each of `H_msg`'s four FIPS inputs is moved on its own and the digest is required to move
with it, and `PRF_msg` is moved in each of its two.  The seventh is that the two sites' randomizers
differ, and the eighth is the exclusive-or fold's collision, which is what makes a routed forgery on
an unsigned message exhibitable here.

The next four separate the two forgery sites — different FORS instance address, different FORS
message, different layer-zero position and different top-layer position — and pin that both FORS
trees and both hypertree layers are live: the four global FORS leaves of a site carry four distinct
addresses, matched against a table written out by hand, and the two layers' honest roots and honest
running messages differ.

The last four are the agreement checks.  Every honest value the canaries evaluate is recomputed
here from the construction's primitives, and each is asserted equal to the witness modules' own
computation of it, so the canaries check the extractor against tables written independently of the
library's and known to match it. -/

of the seven signatures the fixture builds, with `sigA` taken at both of the messages that share its

address table rather than through `forsSigLeafIndex`.

/-! ## The hypertree arm -/

/-- One hypertree-arm canary, for the case where the extractor returns a WOTS+ `F`-preimage.

The signature verifies, its recovered FORS public key differs from the honest one — which is what
routes it here — and the extractor reports the layer and the WOTS+ chain and step named.  The
returned witness is then re-evaluated against three deliberately wrong arguments, one at a time:
the other layer's tree address, the other layer's leaf, and — this is the naive identification the
canary exists to defeat — the message the forged signature actually carries at this layer, which is
the value a reader would reach for if the honest partner were read off the signature instead of
computed from `sk`.  All three are required to fail, as is moving to the other layer as a whole.

Moving the honest running message to the *other layer's* honest one is a fourth re-evaluation, and
at this fixture it is inert, so it is asserted to hold rather than to fail.  The reason is exact and
is asserted with it: `WotsWitness.Valid`'s `fPreimage` branch reads the honest message only through
`chainStepsCore` at the extracted chain — the honest revealed value there is the honest chain
advanced by exactly that many steps — and the two layers' honest running messages have the same
step count at that chain.  The naive message does not: its step count differs, which is why that
move discriminates and this one does not. -/

/-- The hypertree-arm canary for the case where the extractor returns an XMSS `H`-collision.  That
branch of `XmssWitness.Valid` never reads the honest running message, so the two message
re-evaluations of `checkHypertreeArm` cannot discriminate and are asserted to hold instead; what
discriminates is the tree address and, because the two layers' leaves give different node indices
at the extracted height, the leaf.

The second of those two is made at `inert`, which the caller supplies.  Any value of the right type
would do — the branch reads none — so it is taken as an argument rather than borrowed from another
signature's construction, where it would suggest a connection that does not exist. -/

a digest, an instance address, a FORS message, a layer-zero position and every honest value; they
differ only in their FORS halves.  One routes to the FORS arm and the other to the hypertree arm, so
the arm is decided by the FORS public-key comparison and by nothing else.

The second half of this canary pins what `Witness.Valid` does *not* see.  Offered against `sigE`,
the FORS witness extracted from `sigD` still holds — and it must, because `Witness.Valid` reads the
signature only through the digest its randomizer produces, and the two digests are equal.  The arm
selection is a property of `findWitness`, not of the predicate, and the pin above is what checks it;
asserting a rejection here would be asserting something false. -/

/-- A witness the extractor did not return, offered at a site.  A `Fin toyParams.d` label makes an
out-of-range layer a build error rather than a rejected run, so no fabrication below carries one.

The two `T_k` fabrications falsify one conjunct each, and they are the two conjuncts that branch
has: the honest root vector itself compresses to the honest compression but is not distinct from it,
and the honest vector with its first entry moved by two is distinct but does not compress to it —
two rather than one because the toy `T_k` discards the low bit of every root it folds and this
fixture's honest first entry is even, so a move by one changes only the dropped bit: it is distinct
from the honest vector and still compresses to it, an *accepted* second preimage rather than a
rejected one.  A move by two carries into a bit the fold keeps. -/

/-! ### Game-shape pins

`Witness.Valid` is stated in the construction's own vocabulary.  These seven `example`s compose its
two unfolding equations with the lane's seven `_eval` bridges — one per leaf branch — so a consumer
holding a composite witness reaches each canonical game's `eval` at the encoded tweak in one step.
No bridge is restated in the library; these pin that none needs to be. -/

-- Not exposed, and that was measured: dropping the attribute from both leaves the module clean.
-- The two abbreviations exist only to keep the four hypertree-arm pins below readable, whose
-- hypothesis comes back from `HypertreeWitness.valid_iff` spelled with `advance` and
-- `honestLayerMsg` rather than with these names; all 41 uses of them sit inside those four pins,
-- and a pin is an `example`, which is not exported and so unfolds an unexposed definition freely
-- where a `theorem` would be refused.  Nothing outside this executable consumes them.
