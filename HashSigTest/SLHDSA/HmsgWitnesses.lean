# SLH-DSA `H_msg` ITSR bridge canaries

Executable checks that the two coordinate maps an `HmsgIndex` supplies are the ones the lane's FORS
statements are indexed by, that the widening of the hashed input from a message to
`⟨PK.seed, PK.root, M⟩` costs nothing inside one key pair and buys the adversary something outside
one, and that the first-uncovered-index extractor returns the index it claims to — all evaluated at
values, not restated from the theorems.

## The profile is the scheme-dispatch fixture's, and why it is copied rather than imported

The bundle below is the one `HashSigTest.SLHDSA.SchemeWitnesses` builds — the same seven
parameters, the same six byte maps, the same three honest seeds and second public seed, the same
published root — so the two executables run on one profile, and a reviewer can check that by
diffing the two blocks.  It is copied rather than imported because a `lean_exe` root must own its
`main`, and a module that imports the other one cannot declare `main` at all: the attempt reports
`` `main` has already been declared``, and had it not, the executable would silently link the
imported `main` and run the other fixture.  The lane has no shared fixture module yet, and adding
one would edit a merged, reviewed file from inside this pull request.

That diff has exactly seven entries, all deliberate.  The failure message names this executable.
`toy` carries no `@[expose]` here, because removing that attribute in this file produces no errors
at all.  Two attribute comments carry this file's own measured error counts and error text rather
than the other fixture's — every attribute comment here was written by removing the attribute and
reading what Lean said.  And three docstrings in the copied block name the group that asserts what
they describe, which is `checkFixture` here and `checkToyBundle` there.  Strip the comments, the
docstrings and that one dropped attribute, and the two blocks differ in a single string: the
failure message.

## What the profile already supplies, and the one thing it does not

Everything the coverage canaries need was already in it.  `k = 2` gives every digest two semantic
indices, so "every index covered" and "some index covered" are different events and
`List.find?`'s first-match choice is visible; `a = 1` gives two leaves per FORS tree, so the four
global leaves `0, 1, 2, 3` are distinct and the tree offset in `globalLeaf` is load-bearing; the
public seed is a byte rather than a unit and `H_msg` reads all four of its FIPS arguments, so the
`⟨PK.seed, PK.root, M⟩` record is not inert and a candidate can be moved off the honest key pair.

The one addition is `blindPrimitives`: the same bundle with a single field replaced by an `H_msg`
that ignores the seed and root it is handed.  Nothing in the scheme-dispatch fixture needed such a
bundle, and the strictness of the widening cannot be exhibited without one.

## The fixture's six pairs

One forged pair and five signing queries, all at the honest key pair.  The forged message produces
the digest `[0xBB, 0x27, 0xAB]`, which names layer-zero tree three, leaf three, and selects FORS
tree zero's local leaf one and FORS tree one's local leaf zero.  Four of the queries realise all
four coverage patterns against that pair of indices:

* `qBoth` reproduces the forged digest exactly under a different randomizer *and* a different
  message, so it covers both indices while leaving the pair fresh — the fixture's win;
* `qFirst` sits at the same FORS instance and covers the first index only;
* `qSecond` sits at the same FORS instance and covers the second index only;
* `qOther` sits at a different FORS instance and covers neither.

The fifth, `qHonestOnly`, covers both indices at the honest key pair *without* reproducing the
digest — coverage is a relation between selected indices, not between digests, and a fixture whose
only win came from a digest collision would not have shown that.  It is also what makes the fibre
equivalence's key pair falsifiable: at either of the two moved key pairs it covers neither index, so
reading the source-shaped side anywhere but at the honest key pair changes the answer.  Without it
the equivalence canary passed under a mutant that read that side at a different public seed, because
`qBoth`'s digest collision is an additive one that survives moving the seed and the root.

`qSecond` and `qOther` share a randomizer and differ only in their message, which is asserted: ITSR
freshness is *pair* freshness, and a fixture in which no two queries shared a key could not show
that.

## Which conjunct each canary falsifies

`ITSRProblem.Wins` has two conjuncts and both are falsified on their own.  Against `[qC, qBoth]`
the candidate is one of the targets, so freshness fails while coverage is asserted to hold; against
`[qOther]`, `[qFirst]` or `[qSecond]` coverage fails while freshness is asserted to hold; against
`[qBoth]` both hold and the pair wins.

`findUncoveredIndex_eq_some_iff` has three parts, and the third — that every index before the
returned one is covered — is the one soundness does not decide.  Four target sets separate them:
with only the second index covered the first comes back; with only the first covered the second
comes back; with neither covered the first comes back and the second is required *not* to, which is
the case a last-match extractor would get wrong; with both covered nothing comes back.

`HmsgIndex.ext_of_coords` takes two hypotheses and neither is idle: over all sixty-four semantic
indices of this profile the pair `(instance address, global leaf)` is injective, while the address
alone is not, the global leaf alone is not, and neither is the address paired with the *local* leaf
— the naive reading of `globalLeaf` with the tree offset dropped.

`coord_unrevealed_of_notMem` denies a conjunction of two, and both halves are exercised by
different queries in one transcript: `qFirst` sits at the uncovered index's own instance address and
misses on the leaf, `qOther` misses on the address.  The converse is asserted too — for the index
that *is* covered, some query and tree do land on its coordinate — so the lemma is not vacuous.

`wins_of_hmsg_agree` takes two hypotheses and both are falsified: with the two inputs equal the win
fails on freshness, and at the fixture's own bundle, where the two digests differ, it fails on
coverage.

## The naive identifications this fixture is built to reject

* *That `globalLeaf` is the local leaf.*  Rejected six times over, each measured on its own with
  the other five removed: against `forsSigLeafIndex`, which is separately reviewed and carries the
  FIPS citation; against a hand-written `tree · 2 ^ a + leaf`; against the divide-back to the FORS
  tree; against the `k · 2 ^ a` bound; against the secret value honest signing reveals at the
  coordinate; and against a hand-written list of the two global leaves the forged digest is
  expected to select, read through the hand-written `Adrs` table.  A shift of `globalLeaf` carried
  through the library until it elaborates clean moves nine declarations, and then fails at each of
  those six.  The *per-index* read of that `Adrs` table is not one of them: the shifted global leaf
  stands on both sides of its comparison, so with it alone the shift passes.  It pins how
  `forsNodeAdrs` builds an address from a given global leaf, not which global leaf.  The `Nodup`
  sweep over the sixty-four indices lets the shift through for its own reason: a shift merely
  permutes those sixty-four leaves, so they stay distinct.
* *That `findUncoveredIndex` returns "an" uncovered index.*  Rejected by the empty-transcript case,
  where both are uncovered and the returned one is required to be the earlier.
* *That the ITSR candidate may carry any `(PK.seed, PK.root)`.*  Rejected by the two off-fibre
  candidates, which are asserted to be fresh — for free, against a transcript that contains their
  underlying pair — and asserted still not to win.
* *That the widened game is the source's game.*  Rejected by `blindPrimitives`, which agrees with
  the fixture's bundle on every source-shaped case the fixture runs and still loses the widened game
  to a single target query, which the fixture's own bundle refuses.

## The pins

Every one of the thirty-five theorems the library module exports appears as an `example` at this
bundle's types, with generic arguments where the statement has them.  Seven further `example`s are
the profile's own `decide` pins, inherited with the copied block.

/-- The two coordinate maps, against tables written out by hand.

`HmsgIndex.forsAdrs` is required to agree with the digest's own `DigestParts.forsAdrs` *and* with a
hand-written `Adrs` record — at the forged digest, and at one further index whose two digest words
differ, because the forged digest names layer-zero tree three and key pair three alike and on it
alone a swap of those two address words is invisible.  `HmsgIndex.globalLeaf` is required to agree
with `forsSigLeafIndex`, with a hand-written `tree · 2 ^ a + leaf`, with the divide-back to the
FORS tree, with the `k · 2 ^ a` bound, and with a hand-written pair of global leaves.

The per-index leaf-address check reads the same global leaf on both sides, so what it pins is how
`forsNodeAdrs` builds an address from a given global leaf, not which global leaf; the pair check
beside it reads that table at hand-written leaves instead, and so, unlike the per-index read, it
moves under a shift of `globalLeaf`.

On this profile the pair check also *implies* the per-index read: the two lists it compares are the
same two indices the loop walks, so pointwise it gives exactly the per-index equation.  Measured
both ways — with the per-index read deleted the executable still passes, and with it and the
`range 4` sweep both deleted a leaf-address table shifted by one is still caught, at the pair
check.  The per-index read is kept anyway, because it is the law about `forsNodeAdrs` quantified
over the index that a reader checks the imported function against, rather than a statement about
these two values. -/

/-- The strictness of the widening, exhibited.

`blindPrimitives` differs from the fixture's bundle in one field: its `H_msg` ignores the `PK.seed`
and `PK.root` it is handed and hashes at the fixture's own key pair instead.  Its source-shaped
problem at *any* key pair is therefore the fixture's bundle's at the honest one — the two are
asserted to agree on every randomizer and message the fixture uses, and their winning conditions on
four of its target lists — while its widened game falls to a single target query, which the
fixture's own bundle refuses.  That is the separation: source-shaped hardness does not carry to the
widened game.  The break is asserted in both of the two directions the bundle is blind in — moving
the public seed and moving the published root — because the docstring above claims blindness in
both.  The last two checks falsify the two hypotheses the win rests on, one each. -/
