# SLH-DSA hypertree witness canaries

Executable checks that the hypertree layer walk selects the *right layer*, and that the witness it
returns there really attacks the honest key material of that layer's tree — evaluated at the
values, not restated from the theorems.

No collision is exhibitable under an approved instantiation, so the extraction canaries run over a
toy primitive bundle whose `Thash` folds its input with a two-bit shift and drops the low bit of
every child, then exclusive-ors a tweak derived from the whole address, layer and tree words
included.  Its secret map takes the layer and the tree words as well as the key-pair and chain
words, rather than the key-pair and chain alone, so that the three trees are not copies of one
another; `checkToyBundle` asserts the consequence the canaries use.  The witness lemmas are stated
for an arbitrary `Primitives` bundle, so this is in scope; it is a falsifiability fixture, not a
claim about any approved profile.

The profile has **three** layers of height two, which is the point: at `d = 3` there is a layer —
the middle one — whose neighbours in both directions are in range, so an index one off is not
caught by the bound alone.  The trajectory the digest parts fix is `(layer 0, tree 6, leaf 3)`,
`(layer 1, tree 1, leaf 2)`, `(layer 2, tree 0, leaf 1)` — three positions differing in all three
coordinates, so a layer read one too high or one too low moves the tree address, the leaf *and* the
honest running message together.

## The three forgeries

One per divergence layer, each a full-depth hypertree signature that recovers the published root
from a forged message.  At the divergence layer the component is the honest XMSS signer applied to
the *running* message arriving there — a signature the honest signer never produced at that
message, which recovers that tree's honest root all the same.  Below it the components carry a
perturbed authentication path, so their recovered roots miss their layers' honest roots and the
walk cannot stop early.  Above it the components are the honest hypertree signature's own, which is
sound because the running message arriving one layer up is that tree's honest root either way.

`checkLayer` runs one of them.  It pins that the walk reaches the published root, that the message
signed at the divergence layer is not the honest one there and that that layer's own recovery is
the honest root; it pins the layer *and the constructor* the extractor reports; evaluates the
returned witness at that layer's tree address, leaf and honest running message; and then
re-evaluates the *same* witness four more times per neighbouring layer: once for each of those
three arguments, changing one at a time, and once with all three moved together, which is
`HypertreeWitness.Valid` as a whole.  Each of the four is required to fail.

The three single-argument re-evaluations bite only because all three forgeries extract an
`fPreimage` witness, which is why the constructor is pinned rather than assumed.  `checkLayerH`
runs the other case and says what changes there.

## The other canaries

`checkLayerH` is the fourth extraction canary and the only one that reaches the `hCollision`
branch: a layer-zero component whose WOTS+ part is fabricated rather than signed, whose
authentication path is the honest one for the forged message, and which recovers layer zero's
honest root all the same.  Its assertion set is matched to that branch, because two of
`checkLayer`'s three re-evaluations do not discriminate an `hCollision` witness and one of them
never can.  `XmssWitness.Valid`'s `hCollision` branch does not mention the honest message at all,
so the honest-message re-evaluation is inert at every layer; and the leaf enters only as
`idx / 2 ^ z`, so at the extracted height `z = 1` the leaves `3` and `2` of layers zero and one
share the node index `1` and the leaf re-evaluation is inert between them, while layer two's leaf
`1` gives node index `0` and does discriminate.  What discriminates at both neighbours is the tree
address.  The leaf inertness is asserted to *hold*, so it is pinned rather than passed over; it
turns on this fixture's two leaves sharing a node index, and it fails if the trajectory changes.
The honest-message inertness is not asserted, because it would not be an independent assertion:
`xmssWitnessHolds` takes the honest message as an argument and its `hCollision` branch never reads
it, so re-evaluating the same witness at a neighbouring layer's honest message is the same
computation as the check that the witness holds at its own layer.  A pin on it would test
`xmssWitnessHolds` against `XmssWitness.Valid`, not the extractor.

`checkNoWitness` closes both ways the search can return nothing.  The honest hypertree signature
extracted against the message it actually signs matches at layer zero and still returns nothing,
because at `msg = msg'` every chain's two step counts agree and the WOTS+ chain search runs out;
re-running the same walk against a *distinct* second message returns a layer-zero witness, which is
what pins that layer zero was reached rather than missed.  It also pins that the honest walk
reaches the published root, so that nothing coming back cannot be blamed on a walk that never got
there.  And a walk whose three layers all miss their honest roots reaches the last layer without a
match and stops.

`checkEarlyMatch` runs a walk that matches at layer zero and then misses the published root.  A
witness comes back and holds, which is `findHypertreeWitness_sound` carrying no top-root
hypothesis.

`checkFabricatedWitnesses` is the tally: nine runs of `hypertreeWitnessHolds`, three accepted and
six rejected.  The six are the in-range layer shifts, and they falsify the one conjunct
`HypertreeWitness.Valid` has — the XMSS condition at the position and honest message the label
names.  There is no out-of-range fabrication, and there cannot be one: `HypertreeWitness.layer` is
a `Fin toyParams.d`, so a label at or beyond `d` is not a witness at this walk length and does not
elaborate.  What used to be two run-time rejections is a build error now, exercised by the mutation
that widens the label's index rather than by an `ensure`.

The `example`s pin the theorem statements at that bundle, including the nine declarations with no
consumer inside the library, and the ledger and encoded-tweak lemmas at the same profile — which
is inside the approved address bounds, so no second parameter record is introduced.

/-! ## Witness validity, evaluated

`xmssWitnessHolds` re-evaluates the condition each `XmssWitness` constructor asserts, at an
address, a leaf and an honest message supplied as arguments, and from honest values recomputed
here rather than read off `XmssWitness.Valid` or `WotsWitness.Valid`.  Taking those three as
arguments is what lets the layer canaries below run the *same* witness at a neighbouring layer's
address, at a neighbouring layer's leaf, and against a neighbouring layer's honest message, and
watch each one fail on its own.

`hypertreeWitnessHolds` supplies those three from the layer, through `posOf` and `honestMsgAt` —
which are written out by hand, so they are a second computation of what `LayerPosition.advance` and
`honestLayerMsg` compute.  `checkToyBundle` asserts the two agree at all three layers.  It adds no
bound of its own: the label is a `Fin toyParams.d` and the bound is in its type. -/

/-! ## The bundle behaves as advertised -/

/-- Seven fixture properties, in seven `ensure` sites, one of them a three-layer loop.

The three honest XMSS roots are pairwise distinct, and so are the three honest running messages, so
a witness read at the wrong layer is read against a different honest partner.  The four honest
leaves of each of the three trees are pairwise distinct, so no two leaves of one tree share one.
The hand-written `posOf` agrees with `LayerPosition.advance` and the hand-written `honestMsgAt`
with `honestLayerMsg`, at all three layers, so the layer canaries below check the extractor against
a table that is written independently of the library's and known to match it.

Those two agreement checks are load-bearing, not documentation, and it is worth saying what they
carry now that the library also carries part of it.  When `HypertreeWitness.layer` was a bare `ℕ`,
shifting the extractor's label and `HypertreeWitness.Valid`'s reading of it *together* — labelling
the base case `⟨1, ·⟩` and reading `w.layer - 1` — re-proved `findHypertreeWitness_sound` by the
same induction, and the executable was the only thing that noticed.  The label is a `Fin layers`
now, so that particular shift no longer elaborates — but the class is not closed by the type.  The
reflection `t ↦ layers - 1 - t`, counting the layer from the top of the walk instead of from the
walk's start, agrees with the identity at walk length one, which is the only place `Fin layers` pins
anything, and it re-proves the library.  What stops it is in this module: the statement pins below
restate the two shape equations and `HypertreeWitness.Valid`'s body with the label read raw, so the
reflection is a build error *here* at five sites; and renumbering those pins with it leaves
`checkLayer`'s pin failing at run time with `layer 0: layer index is 0`, the reflected extractor
reporting layer two for the layer-zero divergence.  These checks stay because they are what caught
this class, because they cost nothing, and because they check the numbering a second way, not
through `HypertreeWitness.Valid`: `checkLayer`'s `w.layer == layer` pin compares against the label
the fixture *built* the divergence at, and `hypertreeWitnessHolds` reads `posOf` and `honestMsgAt`.
Renumbering those two tables to match some other labelling makes them stop agreeing with `advance`
and `honestLayerMsg` at the fixed layers `0`, `1` and `2`, and the agreement check fails.  Without
them the executable would be a restatement of the library at whatever numbering the library
happened to use; with them it is an independent one.  The hand-written honest chain ends agree with
`wotsPkGenTops`, which is what `XmssWitness.Valid` names.  And the hand-assembled honest hypertree
signature is the one `GeneralHypertree.sign` produces. -/

/-! ## The three layer canaries -/

/-- One layer canary.  `sig` recovers the published root from the forged message, and the first
layer whose own recovered root is that layer's honest root is `layer`.  The check pins the layer
and the constructor the extractor reports, evaluates the returned witness at that layer's address,
leaf and honest message, and then re-evaluates the *same* witness against each other layer's
address, each other layer's leaf and each other layer's honest message, one at a time, and against
each other layer as a whole, which moves all three together; every one of those four is required to
fail.

The three positions of this fixture differ in all of layer, tree and leaf — `(0, 6, 3)`, `(1, 1,
2)` and `(2, 0, 1)` — so a layer read one too high or one too low moves the tree address, the leaf
and the honest running message together.

Whether each of the three re-evaluations then isolates one of them depends on which `XmssWitness`
constructor came back, which is why `branch` is pinned rather than left open.  All three callers
extract an `fPreimage` witness, and for that constructor all three do bite: `WotsWitness.Valid`'s

/-- The `hCollision` layer canary: the one extraction canary that does not return a WOTS+ witness.

Its point is that `checkLayer`'s three re-evaluations are not all discriminating for every witness
shape, and this is the shape they are not discriminating for.  Which of them bite is read off
`XmssWitness.Valid`'s `hCollision` branch, not guessed:

* the tree address enters through `xmssNodeAdrs adrs z (idx / 2 ^ z)` and through
  `xmssHonestChildren`, so the address re-evaluation fails at both neighbouring layers;
* the leaf enters only as `idx / 2 ^ z`.  The extracted height is `z = 1` and this fixture's leaves
  are `3`, `2` and `1`, so layers zero and one share the node index `1` and the leaf re-evaluation
  is *inert* between them, while layer two's node index is `0` and it does fail there;
* the honest message does not appear in the branch at all, so the honest-message re-evaluation is
  inert at every layer, and no fixture can make it otherwise.

The leaf inertness is asserted to *hold*, so it is pinned rather than skipped: it turns on the
fixture's leaves `3` and `2` quotienting to the same node index at `z = 1`, and a different
trajectory breaks it.  The honest-message inertness is *not* asserted, and the reason is that it
would not be an independent assertion: `xmssWitnessHolds` takes the honest message as an argument
and this branch never reads it, so `xmssWitnessHolds adrs idx (honestMsgAt other) w.witness` and
`xmssWitnessHolds adrs idx (honestMsgAt 0) w.witness` are the same evaluation — and the second is
what `hypertreeWitnessHolds w` already asserts, the layer having been pinned to zero just before.
A pin on it would fail only if `xmssWitnessHolds` or `XmssWitness.Valid` changed, not if the
extractor did.  `hypertreeWitnessHolds` at each other layer
— which moves all three arguments together — is still required to fail. -/

/-! ## What the search does when no layer matches, and when one matches early -/

/-- The honest hypertree signature, extracted against the message it actually signs.  Every layer's
recovered root is that layer's honest root, so the search stops at layer zero — and returns nothing
all the same, because at `msg = msg'` every chain's two step counts agree and the WOTS+ chain
search runs out.  That is `findHypertreeWitness_isSome`'s message-distinctness hypothesis being
necessary: the walk does reach the published root, and it does match at layer zero, so the other
way of returning nothing — no layer matching at all — is not available either, and nothing coming
back cannot be blamed on a walk that never got there; and re-running the same signature at the same
walk against a *distinct* second message returns a witness at layer zero, which is what pins that
the branch taken was layer zero's rather than a failure to match.

The second half runs a walk none of whose layers matches: three copies of the perturbed layer-zero
signature, which miss the honest root at all three layers, so the search reaches the last layer
without a match and stops.
Those are the only two ways nothing comes back. -/

/-! ## Fabricated witnesses

Nine witnesses run through `hypertreeWitnessHolds`, three accepted and six rejected.  The three
accepted are the extractor's own answers at the three layers.  The six rejected are the in-range
layer shifts, and they falsify the one conjunct `HypertreeWitness.Valid` has: the XMSS condition at
the position and honest message the label names.  The per-argument separation — address, leaf,
honest message — is `checkLayer`'s.

An out-of-range fabrication is not among them because it is not writable.  `HypertreeWitness.layer`
is a `Fin toyParams.d`, so `⟨3, w⟩` and `⟨9, w⟩` — which this tally used to carry, as the two
rejections that isolated the old bound conjunct — are type errors rather than rejected runs.  The
bound is exercised at build time instead, by the mutation that widens the label's index. -/

/-! ## Statement pins

The theorems this module ships, elaborated at the toy profile.  Nine declarations have no consumer
inside the library and nothing else in the tree elaborates them — every name declared in
`HashSig.SLHDSA.Security.HypertreeWitnesses` that occurs exactly once in the code of `HashSig/`,
which is its own declaration line, nothing there importing that module: the two extractor shape
equations, the two extractor lemmas `findHypertreeWitness_sound` and `findHypertreeWitness_isSome`,
the `atLayer` bridge, the top-level walk, the cross-layer encoded-distinctness lemma, the
honest-signer bridge `signFromPosition_getElem`, and `LayerPosition.advance_ne`.  Each is pinned
here.  `HypertreeWitness.valid_iff` is not among them — `findHypertreeWitness_sound` rewrites with
it — and neither is `HypertreeWitness.layer_lt`, which is what `HypertreeWitness.Valid` forms its
position with; both are pinned all the same, in the form a consumer meets them.  The honest-signer
bridge is pinned as the layer-`j` component read against `honestLayerMsg`, and all three WOTS+
cross-layer separations are composed here the way the module docstring says they compose:
`wotsPkAdrsKey_injective` against `advance_ne` directly, `wotsOptionalStepAdrsKey_injective`
through the `congrArg Prod.fst` its `WotsChainCoord` conclusion needs, and
`wotsStepAdrsKey_injective` through the `congrArg (·.1.1)` its pair-valued conclusion needs.

Two of these pins carry more than their statements.  The extractor's dichotomy pin writes both
shape equations' labels out literally and the soundness pin writes `Valid`'s body with
`w.layer.val` read raw against `HypertreeWitness.layer_lt`, so a relabelling of the extractor that
the library's own `Fin layers` type admits — the reflection `t ↦ layers - 1 - t` — stops
elaborating at these five sites, in this module, before the canaries run. -/

contradicts `LayerPosition.advance_ne` in one step, which is what the module docstring claims and
what this pins. -/

/-- And for the `fPreimage` branch, whose ledger `optionalWotsAddresses` is indexed by the
`WotsChainCoord` a selection picks a step of.  `wotsOptionalStepAdrsKey_injective` concludes that
coordinate equality directly, so one `congrArg Prod.fst` projects the position out. -/
