# SLH-DSA encoded target-ledger canaries

Executable checks that the concrete address encoders keep the reachable target ledgers
duplicate-free, run at the values rather than through the theorems: `Sha2Address.ofAdrs` is applied
to every ledger entry and the encoded key lists are compared for duplicates at both key widths.
The checks distinguish the total UD cap completion from a synthetic partial UD selection.  The
synthetic selector exercises only the generic partial-selection interface; it is not the exact
selector or trace relation of a later reduction.  The checks also cover an independent optional
PRE selection.

Two further groups pin the negative direction, because the ledgers of a small profile keep every
field far below its encoded width and so exercise no boundary on their own.  `checkFieldBoundaries`
walks the SHA-2 layer and tree fields across their exact limits.  `checkFallbackAliasing` shows what
each encoder does past its domain: SHA-2 returns the all-zero key, which is the genuine key of the
all-zero WOTS-hash address rather than a sentinel, and SHAKE truncates each field to its width, so
two addresses differing only above a width collide silently.

One group is kernel-checked rather than run: a parameter set whose hypertree is too tall for
SHA-2's compressed tree field separates the two conditions theorems.  It satisfies the canonical
bounds, provably fails the approved ones, the SHAKE conditions hold for it, and the SHA-2
conditions are refutable.

/-! ## Profiles

The two tweak-map bridges `adrsToKey_sha2` / `adrsToKey_shake` and the deep separating profile
come from `HashSigTest.SLHDSA.EncoderFixtures`, which shares them with the WOTS+ witness
canaries. -/

/-! ### A profile SHA-2's compressed layout cannot hold

The two encoders need different amounts of the parameter set, and `EncoderFixtures.deep`
separates them: its hypertree carries ninety tree-index bits, which the canonical twelve-byte tree
word holds and the compressed eight-byte one does not. -/
