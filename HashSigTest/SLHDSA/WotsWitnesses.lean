# SLH-DSA WOTS+ witness canaries

Executable checks that the WOTS+ witness extractor really produces witnesses, and that what it
produces really satisfies the collision or preimage equation — evaluated at the values, not
restated from the theorems.

No collision is exhibitable under an approved instantiation, so the extraction canaries run over a
toy primitive bundle whose `Thash` collapses its input (`F x = x >>> 1` on a one-byte node type).
The witness lemmas are stated for an arbitrary `Primitives` bundle, so this is in scope; it is a
falsifiability fixture, not a claim about any approved profile.  Over that bundle the checks build
an honest WOTS+ signature, three forgeries that all recover the honest public key, and confirm
that the extractor returns the `F`-collision, the `F`-preimage, and the `T_len` second preimage
respectively, each satisfying its equation by evaluation — including the two identifications the
games need, that the collision partner is the honest chain value at the address named and that the
preimage is taken at the address the honest signer hashed.  Two negative canaries close the other
direction: signing the same message twice yields no witness at all, and a forgery whose recovered
public key differs yields a `T_len` witness that fails its own validity check — which is exactly
why `findWotsWitness_sound` carries the public-key hypothesis.

The `example`s pin the theorem statements at that bundle and at approved profiles.  The last group
is kernel-checked rather than run: on a profile whose layer-zero tree indices overflow SHA-2's
compressed eight-byte tree field, two distinct listed chain-step targets encode to the same
all-zero key, so `wotsStepAdrsKey_injective`'s `EncodedTargetLedgerConditions` hypothesis is
load-bearing rather than decorative.

/-! ## The toy bundle

One byte per node, `w = 4`, six chains.  `Thash` exclusive-ors its inputs and shifts the result
right by one bit, so `F x = x >>> 1`, `chain x i s = x >>> s`, and both `F` and `T_len` collide
readily. -/

-- Exposed: the toy fixture's arithmetic has to reduce inside the exposed bundle below and inside
-- the `decide` pins, so the parameter record and the bundle it configures are exposed.  The
-- secret table needs no exposure of its own.  Nothing outside this executable consumes them.

/-- The per-chain secret values the toy `PRF` hands out, indexed by the chain address.

Only chains `0` and `5` are secret-sensitive: chains `1`-`4` take the "no witness" branch, which is
decided by the two messages alone, and under `F x = x >>> 1` the only observables of chain `i`'s
secret `s` are `s >>> b` and `s >>> (w - 1)`, so `4`-`7` are interchangeable here at chain `0` and
`40`-`47` at chain `5`.  Chain `0`'s `4` is chosen so that the collision the extractor finds lies
strictly above the honest digit; at `2` it lay exactly at it, where the chain advance is the
identity and the canaries could not see it. -/

`fPreimage` address is the one the honest signer hashed to reach the revealed value.  It is
deliberately a separate computation from `WotsWitness.Valid`: the checks below run it on the
extractor's actual output. -/

/-- Chain zero: the honest secret is `4`, so the honest signature reveals `2` at the honest digit
`1`, while advancing the forged chain to that digit gives `0`.  Those two do not yet share an `F`
image, so the extractor climbs one further step and returns the collision at hash address two,
between `0` and the honest chain value `1` there.

The collision therefore sits strictly *above* the honest digit, which is what gives the canaries
below any power to tell `WotsWitness.Valid`'s `fCollision` partner — the honest revealed element
advanced by `step - b` — apart from the naive `honestSig[0]`.  The last two checks guard that:
were the collision to move back onto the honest digit, the advance would be the identity and both
identifications would agree at every value this fixture produces. -/
