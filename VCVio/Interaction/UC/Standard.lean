# Textbook UC vocabulary over the abstract open-system theory

This file gives a thin, presentation-layer reading of the abstract
`OpenTheory` / execution infrastructure in the standard Canetti-style UC
vocabulary: `Protocol`, `Functionality`, `Adversary`, `Environment`,
`Simulator`, and an explicit execution experiment `EXEC`.

The point of this file is *faithfulness*. The contextual-equivalence
form `ObservedCompEmulates sem ε π F` quantifies uniformly over arbitrary plugs
`K : T.Plug Δ` under a user-chosen observation semantics. That is
mathematically useful, but it is not by itself the textbook execution
experiment. The paper-level form `UCSecure exec ε π F` fixes that by taking
an explicit `Execution T` and using `∀ A. ∃ S. ∀ Z`-quantification over
real-world adversaries `A`, simulators `S`, and environments `Z`.

The bridge `observedCompEmulates_toUCSecure_id` (this file) shows that
semantic emulation implies textbook UC security with the *identity*
simulator `S := A`, exposing a single plug
`K(A, Z) : T.Plug Δ.toPort` via `OpenTheory.plug_wire_left` and then
applying `ObservedCompEmulates` at that plug.

The converse direction (textbook UC implies plug-level
`ObservedCompUCSecure`) goes through Canetti's *dummy-adversary theorem* and is
packaged as the reusable capability `HasDummyAdversaryFactor`.

## Main definitions

* `ProtocolBoundary`: a pair of port boundaries `(main, adv)` for the
  environment-facing and adversary-facing sides of a protocol.
* `ProtocolBoundary.toPort`: the combined `main ⊗ adv` port boundary.
* `Protocol T Δ`, `Functionality T Δ`: open systems exposing
  `Δ.toPort`.
* `Adversary T Δ back`: an open system at
  `swap Δ.adv ⊗ back`; the back-channel `back` carries communication
  between the adversary and the environment.
* `Environment T Δ back`: an open system at
  `swap Δ.main ⊗ swap back`, which is definitionally a
  `T.Plug (Δ.main ⊗ back)`.
* `Simulator T Δ back`: a function from real-world adversaries to
  ideal-world adversaries on the same back-channel.
* `dummyAdversary`: the canonical bidirectional relay
  `idWire Δ.adv : Adversary T Δ Δ.adv` from `HasIdWire`.
* `EXEC π A Z`: the closed system `T.close (T.wire π A) Z`.
* `Execution T`: a concrete distributional interpretation of closed
  systems as UC execution outputs.
* `UCSecure exec ε π F`: textbook computational UC security
  `∀ back A. ∃ S. ∀ Z. exec.distAdvantage (EXEC π A Z) (EXEC F S Z) ≤ ε`.

## Main results

* `observedCompEmulates_toUCSecure_id`: `ObservedCompEmulates sem ε π F` implies
  `UCSecure (Execution.ofSemantics sem) ε π F` with the identity simulator `S := A`.

/-! ## Standard UC roles -/

/--
A protocol's *boundary signature*: a pair of port boundaries recording
the two directed interfaces a protocol exposes.

* `main` is the interface to the environment / honest parties (inputs
  in, outputs out).
* `adv` is the interface to the adversary / network (network packets,
  scheduling tokens, leakage, etc.).

Both sides are full `PortBoundary`s rather than bare `Interface`s
because each direction generally carries traffic in both directions.

/-- A *simulator* maps a real-world adversary to an ideal-world
adversary on the same back-channel.

This is the lightweight presentation form. A more structural variant
keeps the simulator as an open system on
`Δ.adv ⊗ swap Δ.adv` and applies it via `wire`; both variants are
interconvertible in any compact-closed `OpenTheory`. -/

/-! ## The execution experiment -/

/--
`EXEC π A Z` is the closed-system execution obtained by wiring the
protocol `π` to the adversary `A` along their shared `adv` boundary,
and then closing the result against the environment `Z`.

By definitional equality of `swap (X ⊗ Y)` with `swap X ⊗ swap Y`,
the type of `Z` is exactly the `T.Plug` of the wired result, so no
explicit boundary transport is needed.

  T.close (T.wire π A) Z

/-! ## Textbook UC security -/

/--
`UCSecure exec ε π F` is the textbook computational UC security
statement: for every adversary `A`, there exists a simulator `S` such
that no environment `Z` can distinguish the real-world execution
`EXEC π A Z` from the ideal-world execution `EXEC F S Z` with
advantage greater than `ε`.

The quantifier structure `∀ back A. ∃ S. ∀ Z` is exactly Canetti's
formulation; in particular, the simulator may depend on the adversary
but not on the environment. The back-channel `back` is universally
quantified to allow the environment-adversary side-channel to be
arbitrary.

  ∀ (back : PortBoundary) (A : Adversary T Δ back),
  ∃ S : Adversary T Δ back,
  ∀ Z : Environment T Δ back,
    exec.distAdvantage (EXEC π A Z) (EXEC F S Z) ≤ ε

/-! ## Bridge from observed emulation -/

/--
Computational emulation `ObservedCompEmulates sem ε π F` implies textbook UC
security for the observation-induced execution
`Execution.ofSemantics sem`, with the **identity simulator** `S := A`.
The existential simulator is witnessed by the real-world adversary itself.

The proof rewrites both `EXEC π A Z` and `EXEC F A Z` via
`OpenTheory.plug_wire_left`, exposing the *same* plug
`K(A, Z) : T.Plug Δ.toPort` on both sides, and then applies the
`ObservedCompEmulates` hypothesis at that single plug.

Structural capability for Canetti's dummy-adversary factorization.

Compact closure gives the wiring primitives, but the textbook-to-plug UC
direction also needs a decomposition principle for arbitrary plugs into an
adversary/environment pair. The concrete syntax models can provide that
principle as an instance of this class.

**Dummy-adversary direction.**

Textbook UC security `UCSecure exec ε π F` implies the plug-level
simulator-based form `ObservedCompUCSecure`: given the existential simulator
from `UCSecure` instantiated at the *dummy adversary*, one constructs
a `T.Plug Δ.toPort`-level simulator by repackaging the
adversary-environment pair through the zig-zag identity
`wire_idWire_right`.

This is the content of Canetti's dummy-adversary theorem (cf. Canetti
'01, Thm 4.16). The non-formalized structural decomposition is now an
explicit reusable assumption, `HasDummyAdversaryFactor`, rather than a
local proof hole.
