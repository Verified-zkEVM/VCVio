# Measure semantics of typed interaction paths

Every `FreeM` program is a fully syntactic tree of typed interactions. PolyFun's `withPath`
instrumentation retains the dependent root-to-leaf path selected by the answers, while
`withPathLength` projects that syntax to a plain natural number before any probability semantics
is chosen.

This module denotes those instrumented programs directly as Mathlib measures. The canonical
complexity observer is `queryCountMeasure : Measure ℕ`, which needs no measurable-space choice
for the dependent path type. A full `pathMeasure` remains available when a caller supplies that
choice explicitly; no global measurable-space instance on paths is installed.

The length projection happens in syntax, before denotation, so this canonical observer does not
need a measurable-space instance on `Path program`. -/
