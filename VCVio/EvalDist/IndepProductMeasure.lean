# Independent products denote product measures

`Fin.mOfFn` and `Fintype.mPi` run a family of computations independently and collect the
results as a function. On the measure side their denotation is Mathlib's product measure
`Measure.pi`. The proof does not touch the Giry monad at all: `Measure.pi_eq` characterizes the
product measure by its values on measurable boxes, and on a box the façade bridge
`evalDist_apply` turns the question into the coordinatewise event probability, which
`probEvent_forall_coord_mOfFn`/`probEvent_forall_coord_mPi` already factor. So the statement holds
for every semantics that satisfies `DiscreteEvalDistCompatible`, with no lawfulness assumption.

The coordinate marginals `evalDist_map_eval_mOfFn`/`evalDist_map_eval_mPi` are then Mathlib's
`Measure.pi_map_eval`: pushing the product forward along a coordinate recovers that factor once
the other factors carry full mass, which is the `Pr[⊥ | _] = 0` hypothesis of the façade's
`probEvent_coord_mPi`, read through `evalDist_apply_univ`.
