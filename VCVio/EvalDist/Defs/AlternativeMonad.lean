# Denotational Semantics Over `AlternativeMonad`.

This file defines `HasEvalSet.LawfulFailure`, a type-class refining `MonadLiftT m SetM` when
given an `AlternativeMonad` instance on the base monad, enforcing that `failure` maps to the
empty sub-distribution. Compatibility conditions then force the correct semantics for `evalDist`,
recorded in the `*_failure` simp lemmas below.
