# Identification Scheme with Aborts

This file defines a structure for identification schemes with aborts, as used in ML-DSA
(CRYSTALS-Dilithium). Unlike a standard Σ-protocol (`SigmaProtocol`), the prover's response
may fail (abort), in which case the protocol is retried. This abort mechanism is essential for
the security of lattice-based schemes where masking must hide the secret.

The structure follows the EasyCrypt formalization in `IDSabort.ec` (formosa-crypto/dilithium).

## Type Parameters

- `Stmt`: statement (public key)
- `Wit`: witness (secret key)
- `Commit`: public commitment (sent to the verifier)
- `PrvState`: private prover state (retained between commit and respond)
- `Chal`: verifier challenge
- `Resp`: prover response
- `rel`: the relation proven by the protocol

## Main Definitions

- `IdenSchemeWithAbort`: identification scheme where `respond` returns `Option Resp`
- `IdenSchemeWithAbort.Complete`: honest prover convinces verifier (conditioned on non-abort)
- `IdenSchemeWithAbort.HVZK`: transcript distribution is within a stated TV-distance
  of a simulator
- `IdenSchemeWithAbort.PerfectHVZK`: exact transcript distribution matching with a simulator
- `IdenSchemeWithAbort.CommitmentRecoverable`: ability to recover commitment from the transcript

/-- An identification scheme with aborts for statements in `Stmt` and witnesses in `Wit`, where
`rel : Stmt → Wit → Bool` is the proven relation. The prover's commitment is split into a public
part `Commit` (sent to the verifier) and a private state `PrvState`. The verifier's challenge is
in `Chal`, and the prover's response (which may abort) is in `Resp`.

Unlike `SigmaProtocol`, the `respond` function returns `Option Resp` — `none` indicates an abort
and the protocol must be retried. This is the key mechanism used in Dilithium/ML-DSA to ensure
that the response distribution is independent of the secret. -/

the verifier always accepts. -/

section HVZK

variable [SampleableType Chal] [IsUniformSpec unifSpec]

/-- Approximate honest-verifier zero-knowledge for an identification scheme with aborts:
the transcript distribution produced by the honest prover is within total variation
distance `ζ_zk` of the distribution produced by the simulator.

Both distributions are over `Option (Commit × Chal × Resp)`, where `none` represents an abort.
The parameter `ζ_zk` captures both transcript mismatch and abort-probability mismatch. -/
def HVZK (ids : IdenSchemeWithAbort Stmt Wit Commit PrvState Chal Resp rel)
    (sim : Stmt → ProbComp (Option (Commit × Chal × Resp))) (ζ_zk : ℝ) : Prop :=
  ∀ s w, rel s w = true →
    tvDist (ids.honestExecution s w) (sim s) ≤ ζ_zk

/-- Exact honest-verifier zero-knowledge for an identification scheme with aborts:
the transcript distribution produced by the honest prover exactly matches the
distribution produced by the simulator. -/
def PerfectHVZK (ids : IdenSchemeWithAbort Stmt Wit Commit PrvState Chal Resp rel)
    (sim : Stmt → ProbComp (Option (Commit × Chal × Resp))) : Prop :=
  ∀ s w, rel s w = true →
    𝒟[ids.honestExecution s w] = 𝒟[sim s]

/-- The perfect HVZK property is equivalent to the approximate HVZK property with `ζ_zk = 0`. -/

  simp [PerfectHVZK, HVZK, ← tvDist_eq_zero_iff, le_antisymm_iff, tvDist_nonneg]

end HVZK

section CommitmentRecoverability

/-- Commitment recoverability: any accepting transcript determines the public commitment
from the statement, challenge, and response alone. This property is required for the
CMA-to-NMA reduction in the Fiat-Shamir with aborts security proof.

In Dilithium/ML-DSA, the commitment `w1` can be recomputed as `highBits(Az - c*t)`. -/
def CommitmentRecoverable (ids : IdenSchemeWithAbort Stmt Wit Commit PrvState Chal Resp rel)
    (recover : Stmt → Chal → Resp → Commit) : Prop :=
  ∀ s cm c z,
    ids.verify s cm c z = true →
    recover s c z = cm

end CommitmentRecoverability

section Impersonation

/-- An adversary for the impersonation game against an identification scheme with aborts.
The adversary sees the public key (statement), produces a commitment together with an
internal state, and then responds to a challenge using that state. -/
structure ImpAdv (ids : IdenSchemeWithAbort Stmt Wit Commit PrvState Chal Resp rel)
    (AdvSt : Type) where
  commit (s : Stmt) : ProbComp (Commit × AdvSt)
  respond (s : Stmt) (c : Chal) (st : AdvSt) : ProbComp Resp

variable [SampleableType Chal] [IsUniformSpec unifSpec]

/-- The impersonation experiment: the adversary tries to produce a valid transcript
without knowing the witness, against a fixed statement `s`. -/
def impExp {ids : IdenSchemeWithAbort Stmt Wit Commit PrvState Chal Resp rel}
    {AdvSt : Type} (adv : ImpAdv ids AdvSt) (s : Stmt) : ProbComp Bool := do
  let (cm, st) ← adv.commit s
  let c ← $ᵗ Chal
  let z ← adv.respond s c st
  return ids.verify s cm c z
