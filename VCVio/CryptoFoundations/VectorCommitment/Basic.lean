# Vector Commitments

This file defines `VectorCommitment`, a monad-generic abstraction of a (positional) vector
commitment: a primitive that commits to a whole vector of values `data : ι → α` with a single short
`Commit`, and later lets the committer *open* the value at any individual position `i : ι` with a
short `Opening` that the verifier can check against the commitment alone.

This is the intermediate layer that sits between a concrete construction — such as the inductive
Merkle tree in `VCVio.CryptoFoundations.MerkleTree.Inductive.Defs` (whose vector-commitment
instance is in `VCVio.CryptoFoundations.MerkleTree.Inductive.VectorCommitment`) — and consumers that
only need the positional commit/open/verify interface, such as the Kilian transformation
(`VCVio.CryptoFoundations.Kilian`).

## Type Parameters

- `m`: the monad in which committing and opening run (e.g. `ProbComp`, or a hash-oracle monad).
- `ι`: positions / indices into the committed vector.
- `α`: the value stored at each position.
- `Commit`: the public commitment, sent to the verifier.
- `State`: the committer's private state, retained after committing and used to open positions.
- `Opening`: the per-position opening / proof checked by `verifyOpen`.

Unlike a single-message `CommitmentScheme`, a vector commitment exposes *positional* opening: the
opener reveals only the positions a verifier asks about, paying a per-position `Opening` rather than
a decommitment to the entire vector. Succinctness — `Commit` and `Opening` being much smaller than
the vector — is what makes the primitive interesting, though that is a property of a particular
instance rather than part of this interface.

We also provide `BatchOpeningVectorCommitment`, a variant whose opening and verification work on a
*list* of positions at once with a single `BatchOpening`. The two notions are interconvertible:
`BatchOpeningVectorCommitment.toVectorCommitment` opens singleton batches, and
`VectorCommitment.toBatchOpening` assembles a batch opening from the individual openings. A genuine
batch scheme (e.g. one sharing authentication-path hashes across positions) can be more succinct
than the round-trip through single openings, so the conversions are bridges, not isomorphisms.

## Probability assumptions

As with `ChallengeVerifyProtocol`, probability reasoning is expressed through the standard
`MonadLiftT m SetM` lift introduced in the `EvalDist` layer, so `support` is available for the
monadic `commit` / `openAt` fields.

@[expose] public section

/-- A vector commitment whose `commit` and `openAt` operations run in the monad `m`.

`commit data` commits to the whole vector `data : ι → α`, producing a public `Commit` together with
private `State`. `decode st i` reads back the committed value at position `i` from that state (the
committer always knows what it committed). `openAt st i` produces an `Opening` for position `i`, and
`verifyOpen c i v op` deterministically checks that `op` certifies value `v` at position `i` under
commitment `c`.

The monad is left abstract so an instance may be purely functional (Merkle trees with an explicit
hash function), randomized (`ProbComp`), or oracle-querying. -/

covers a whole *list* of positions, and verification checks a list of position/value `claims` at
once.

This is the natural interface for constructions that amortize work across positions — for instance a
Merkle proof that shares interior sibling hashes between several opened leaves — where a combined
opening can be smaller than the concatenation of per-position openings. -/

section Binding

/-! Binding properties and the committed-value function are stated purely in terms of the
deterministic `verifyBatch` field, so they need no monadic structure on `m` at all. -/

/-- A batch-opening vector commitment is **position binding** if no commitment can be opened at a
single position to two different values: any two (singleton) batch openings that both verify at the
same position and commitment must certify the same value. -/
def PositionBinding (bovc : BatchOpeningVectorCommitment m ι α Commit State BatchOpening) : Prop :=
  ∀ (c : Commit) (i : ι) (v₁ v₂ : α) (op₁ op₂ : BatchOpening),
    bovc.verifyBatch c [(i, v₁)] op₁ = true → bovc.verifyBatch c [(i, v₂)] op₂ = true → v₁ = v₂

/-- **Batch position binding**: across any two verifying batch openings under the same commitment,
claims at a common position certify the same value. This is the batch-level strengthening of
`PositionBinding` (which it recovers via singleton claim lists) and is the shape a consumer needs
when adversarial claim lists are checked whole, as in the Kilian transformation: it lets every
claimed value be read off a single function of the commitment (`committedValue`). Taking the two
openings equal also makes each individual claim list self-consistent across duplicate positions. -/
