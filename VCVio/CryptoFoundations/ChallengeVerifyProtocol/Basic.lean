# Challenge-Verify Protocols

This file defines `ChallengeVerifyProtocol`, a monad-generic abstraction for public-coin
commit–challenge–response protocols, together with the standard security properties:
completeness, soundness (as an interactive argument), special soundness, and honest-verifier
zero-knowledge (HVZK).

It is a close relative of `VCVio.CryptoFoundations.SigmaProtocol.SigmaProtocol`. The difference is
that the prover's computations live in an *arbitrary* monad `m` carrying probability semantics,
rather than being fixed to `ProbComp`. Taking `m := ProbComp` recovers the usual Σ-protocol whose
only randomness is uniform sampling, but a general `m` lets the prover and challenge sampler
additionally query oracles — for instance a hash / Merkle oracle, as needed when realizing the
Kilian transformation (`VCVio.CryptoFoundations.Kilian`) as a succinct interactive argument.

The challenge sampler `sampleChal` is a first-class field and is left fully abstract: it need not be
uniform.

## Type Parameters

- `Stmt`: statement (public input)
- `Wit`: witness
- `Commit`: public commitment (revealed to the verifier)
- `PrvState`: private prover state (retained between commit and respond)
- `Chal`: verifier challenge
- `Resp`: prover response
- `rel`: the relation proven by the protocol
- `m`: the monad in which the prover and challenge sampler run

## Probability assumptions

Probability reasoning is expressed through the standard `MonadLiftT` lifts introduced in the
`EvalDist` layer: `MonadLiftT m SPMF` (for `evalDist` / `Pr[…]` / `tvDist`), `MonadLiftT m SetM`
(for `support`), and the bridge class `EvalDistCompatible m` tying the two together.

universe u v

/-- A challenge-verify protocol for statements in `Stmt` and witnesses in `Wit`,
where `rel : Stmt → Wit → Bool` is the proposition proven by the protocol.
Commitments are split into a public part `Commit` (revealed to the verifier) and a
private part `PrvState` (retained by the prover). Verifier challenges are drawn from `Chal`
via the `sampleChal` computation. Prover responses are in `Resp`.

The prover's computations live in an arbitrary monad `m` carrying probability semantics. Taking
`m := ProbComp` recovers the usual notion of a Σ-protocol whose only randomness is uniform
sampling, but a general `m` lets the prover and challenge sampler additionally query oracles.

We leave properties like special soundness as separate definitions for better modularity. -/

section sound

open scoped NNReal

/-- Soundness of a challenge-verify protocol as an interactive argument, against arbitrary — even
computationally unbounded and adaptive — provers: for every statement outside the relation's
language and every adversarially chosen commitment, the probability over the verifier's challenge
that *some* response would be accepted is at most `soundnessError`.

Because the protocol is public-coin and `verify` is deterministic, quantifying existentially over
the response after the challenge is drawn dominates every prover strategy, so no prover model is
needed: whatever computation produces the response, it can do no better than the best response for
the sampled challenge. -/

challenges admitting any accepted response has probability zero. -/

section speciallySound

/-- Special soundness at a particular statement, relative to an extractor `extract` that recovers a
witness from two accepting transcripts: given two accepting transcripts with the same commitment but
different challenges, the extracted witness is valid.

The extractor is taken as a parameter rather than being a field of `ChallengeVerifyProtocol`, since
a protocol's interaction (`commit`/`respond`/`verify`/`sampleChal`) is independent of any particular
witness-extraction strategy. -/
