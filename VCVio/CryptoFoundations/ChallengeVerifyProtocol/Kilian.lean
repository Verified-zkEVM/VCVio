# The Kilian Transformation

This file is to describe the Kilian transformation ([Kilian '92], [SNARGs book Chapter 20]).
This transformation converts a Probabilistically Checkable Proof (PCP)
into an succinct interactive argument/Sigma protocol using Merkle trees.
This can then be made non-interactive using the Fiat-Shamir transformation,
(these two transformations together are referred to by the SNARGs book as
the "Micali transformation" [Micali '00]).

The majority of the Kilian paper is actually a beautiful way to make the classic GMW graph-coloring
zero-knowledge proof more efficient while keeping zero knowledge by implementing a
"notarized envelope" primitive. But I think this file should just focus on the succinctness part.

/-- A **Probabilistically Checkable Proof (PCP)** system for a relation `rel : Stmt → Wit → Bool`.

  The honest prover turns a statement and witness into a proof string of `length` symbols over the
  alphabet `Symbol`.

  The verifier draws random coins of type `Coins` (sampled by `sampleCoins`); *given* its coins it
  is the deterministic oracle computation `Verifier stmt coins`, which adaptively queries positions
  of the proof string (modeled by `Fin length →ₒ Symbol`) and outputs a single accept/reject bit.

  Separating the coins from the proof queries — rather than folding both into a single
  `OracleComp (unifSpec + (Fin length →ₒ Symbol))` — matches the public-coin structure used by the
  Kilian transformation: the verifier *sends* its coins, and the prover then simulates `Verifier
  stmt coins` to learn exactly which positions to open. -/

section ReadLog

/-! ## Read-log of a deterministic oracle computation

`pathLog so comp` is the list of inputs that `comp` queries, in the order it reads them, when its
oracles are answered by the handler `so`. It is the input-only projection of the generic query log
produced by `QueryImpl.withLogging`: each query/response pair `⟨t, u⟩` is recorded, and `pathLog`
keeps only the inputs `t`. The Kilian prover uses it to discover exactly which proof positions the
verifier reads. -/

  ((simulateQ so.withLogging comp).run.2).map Sigma.fst

`⟨t, so t⟩` for the query, so projecting to inputs prepends `t`. -/

section AnswerFunctions

/-! ## The verifier's claim-lookup handler

The honest parties answer the deterministic PCP verifier with reusable pieces of the generic
`QueryImpl` library: purely with `QueryImpl.ofFn f` (answer query `i` with `f i`), and — when the
prover needs the positions read — with `pathLog` (the read-log built on
`QueryImpl.withTraceAppendBefore`). `claimAnswer` below is the verifier's own per-query handler: a
failing lookup against the prover's claimed `(position, value)` pairs. -/

variable {ι Sym : Type*}

/-- Implement oracle by
looking up an input among the claimed `(input, value)` pairs, failing if absent. This is the
verifier's per-query handler in `KilianTransformation.verify`. It is `QueryImpl.ofFn?` over the

(OptionT Id)`. -/

section KilianTransformation

variable {Stmt Wit : Type}

/-- **The Kilian transformation.**

Turn a `PCP` into a (public-coin) succinct `ChallengeVerifyProtocol`, the interactive argument at
the heart of Kilian's protocol, parameterized by an arbitrary batch-opening vector commitment `bovc`
over the PCP's symbol alphabet (e.g. the inductive Merkle tree of
`VCVio.CryptoFoundations.VectorCommitment.MerkleTree`):

1. the prover commits to its PCP proof string with `bovc.commit` (`commit`);
2. the verifier sends random coins (`sampleChal := pcp.sampleCoins`);
3. the prover simulates `pcp.Verifier stmt coins` against its committed proof to learn exactly which
   positions the verifier reads, and opens *exactly* that set in one shot with `bovc.openBatch`,
   returning the claimed `(position, value)` pairs alongside the batch opening (`respond`);
4. the verifier checks the batch opening against the commitment with `bovc.verifyBatch`, then
   replays `pcp.Verifier stmt coins`, answering each position query from the claimed values, accepts
   iff
   the batch opening verifies, every queried position was claimed, and the PCP verifier accepts
   (`verify`).

A batch-opening commitment is the natural primitive here: Kilian opens a whole set of positions at
once, so a construction that amortizes work across that set (a shared-path Merkle proof, say) is
exactly what makes the argument succinct.

Modeling choices for this definition (correctness/soundness are deferred):

- Positions of the proof string are the commitment indices `Fin pcp.length`; the value at a position
  is a PCP symbol.
- The whole transformation runs in the commitment's monad `m`; the prover's PCP randomness is pulled
  in via `MonadLiftT ProbComp m`. Taking `m := ProbComp` with a standard-model Merkle commitment
  recovers the usual deterministic-verification formulation.
- `Resp` is the claimed `(position, value)` pairs together with a single batch opening. Succinctness
  is what makes Kilian interesting: only the positions the verifier actually queries are opened, and
  `verify` rejects (via the `none` branch of the lookup) if it ever reads an unclaimed position.
- `boolRel` is the `Bool`-valued relation of the resulting protocol; relating it to `pcp.rel` is
  part of the deferred security analysis. -/

section ReplayInfrastructure

/-! ## Deterministic replay infrastructure

The completeness of the Kilian transformation rests on a deterministic fact about the verifier:
the prover's logging simulation (which records the inputs the verifier reads), the verifier's own
replay against the prover's openings, and the bare run on the answer function are all the *same*
deterministic computation answered consistently. These lemmas package that fact for a fixed answer
function `f : ι → Sym` on a single-oracle spec `ι →ₒ Sym`. -/

/-- **Deterministic completeness core.** For a fixed honestly committed state `st` and coins, the

* `hbatch` — the batch opening verifies (vector-commitment correctness); and
* `haccept` — the PCP verifier accepts the committed proof (PCP completeness).

The novel content is the `claimAnswer_run` replay: the verifier's failing `OptionT` replay against
the openings reproduces the bare PCP run, so it accepts exactly when the PCP run does. -/

Two side conditions bridge the gap between PCP completeness (stated over `ProbComp`) and the ambient
monad `m`:

* `hrel` — the protocol's boolean relation refines the PCP relation, so a valid protocol instance
  is a valid PCP instance;
* `hlift` — lifting a `ProbComp` into `m` does not enlarge its support. This is the coherence of
  the public-randomness lift; it cannot be derived from the bare `MonadLiftT ProbComp m` (the lift
  could *a priori* interpret sampling differently from `ProbComp`), so it is required explicitly.
  It holds by `rfl` for `m := ProbComp` and for any faithful lift. -/

/-- **Perfect completeness of the Kilian transformation.** If the underlying batch-opening vector
commitment is complete (perfectly correct) and faithfully decodes its committed vector, and the PCP
is complete (its honest prover's proof is accepted on every sampled coin set), then the resulting
interactive argument is perfectly complete: the honest prover always convinces the verifier.

The hypotheses isolate the moving parts:

* `hbovc` — the batch-opening vector commitment is complete: an honest commitment opens its
  decoded claims to a batch opening that verifies;
* `hdecode` — the committer's state decodes to exactly the vector it committed to;
* `hpcp` — the PCP is complete (`pcp.perfectCorrectness`); together with `hfaithful` (lifting
  `ProbComp` into `m` preserves the distribution) this gives, via
  `perfectCorrectness_accepts_liftedProver`, that the honest proof is accepted on every sampled coin
  set, and (via `neverFail_of_perfectCorrectness`) that the honest prover and sampler never fail;
* `hCommit` / `hOpen` — the commitment's own operations never fail. These are genuinely independent:
  perfect correctness of `bovc` is vacuous if `openBatch` always fails, so it cannot supply them.

The deterministic content lives in `KilianTransformation_verify_eq_true`; here we lift it across the
probabilistic structure, showing the transcript distribution is supported entirely on `true`. -/
