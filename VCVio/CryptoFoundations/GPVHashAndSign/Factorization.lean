/-! ## Adaptive→`signRunF` factorization

The unconditional salt-inclusive U2 `signRunF_tvDist_le_collisionBound` (above) bounds the real and
programmed *salt-inclusive signing runs* — phrased over the fixed `qSign`-step recursion `signRunF`.
To consume it in the four GPV theorems, whose advantage is over the **adaptive** real game run
`simulateQ impl (adv.main pk)` (`SignatureAlg.unforgeableExp`), one must match that adaptive run to
the fixed `signRunF` recursion. That match is the **adaptive→`signRunF` factorization**:
the adversary interleaves its `≤ qSign` signing queries (each drawing one fresh salt `r ← $ᵗ Salt`)
with `≤ qHash` random-oracle queries *adaptively*, while `signRunF` draws its `qSign` salts in a
fixed front sequence. Front-loading the interleaved salt draws past the adaptive adversary fold is a
deferred-sampling joint coupling, structurally identical to the Fiat–Shamir-with-abort
*fold-level tape factorization*
`FiatShamirWithAbort.evalDist_deferredDrawRead_eq_drawList_tapeDrawRead` (each signing body's inline
draws are recast as consumption from a pre-drawn front tape, proved by induction over the
`simulateQ` fold using `OracleComp.DeferredSampling.evalDist_step_commute_tape` for the
answer-irrelevant — here, the adversary hash/uniform — steps and a per-body splice for the drawing
steps).

This section establishes the off-collision branch agreement and packages the factorization as a
typed predicate.

* `regularity_signAnswer_agree` discharges the abstract coupling's off-collision branch-agreement
  hypothesis (`h_step`) for the concrete GPV signing answer: under PSF regularity the *real*
  RO-cache-miss answer `(c, s)` (fresh uniform target `c ← $ᵗ Range`, then
  `s ← trapdoorSample pk sk c`) and the *programmed* answer (`s ← domainSample pk`, target
  `eval pk s`) are equal in distribution. This is the regularity equation transposed and is the
  per-step content the off-collision case of `signRunF_tvDist_le_saltSeq_aux` consumes.

* `AdaptiveFactorizesSignRunF` is the typed predicate packaging the factorization — that the
  adaptive real and programmed game runs are distributed as the corresponding `signRunF` runs over a
  common per-query cache sequence `c` with `card (c j) ≤ j + qHash`. It is a `Prop` (a typed
  obligation, in the style of `hcouple`), naming the deferred-sampling content as a single target.
  `factorized_advantage_le_collisionBound` shows that supplying it discharges the salt-inclusive U2
  against the adaptive game run via the unconditional `signRunF_tvDist_le_collisionBound`. -/

/-- **Regularity branch-agreement bridge.** Under PSF regularity, the real cache-miss
signing answer and the programmed signing answer agree in distribution.

The real answer at a fresh salt — produced by the lazy random oracle on a cache miss — draws a fresh
uniform target `c ← $ᵗ Range` and then a short preimage `s ← trapdoorSample pk sk c`, returning the
pair `(c, s)`. The programmed answer draws `s ← domainSample pk` and uses the target `eval pk s`,
returning `(eval pk s, s)`. PSF regularity (`psf.Regularity`) states exactly that these two joint
distributions coincide, so this is the regularity equation read right-to-left.

This is the GPV-concrete witness for the off-collision branch-agreement hypothesis `h_step` of
`signRunF_tvDist_le_saltSeq` / `signRunF_tvDist_le_collisionBound`: off the per-step salt collision
`r ∉ c j`, the real and programmed per-signing-step answer handlers agree in distribution. -/

/-- **Adaptive→`signRunF` factorization predicate.**

`AdaptiveFactorizesSignRunF realRun progRun` asserts the existence of a `signRunF` presentation of
the adaptive real and programmed game runs sharing a common per-signing-query cache sequence: there
exist a handler-state type `St`, real/programmed per-step answer handlers `stepReal`/`stepProg` (the
latter agreeing with the former off the per-step salt collision, `stepReal` never failing), a
per-query recorded-cache sequence `c` bounded by `card (c j) ≤ j + qHash`, and a start state such
that the real and programmed adaptive runs equal (in distribution) the corresponding
`signRunF stepReal c qSign` / `signRunF stepProg c qSign` runs.

This is the content the deferred-sampling fold-level coupling establishes (cf.
`FiatShamirWithAbort.evalDist_deferredDrawRead_eq_drawList_tapeDrawRead`): front-load the
adaptively-interleaved fresh salt draws of `realRun`/`progRun` into the fixed `qSign`-step
`signRunF` sequence. It is a typed predicate naming the factorization as a single target;
`factorized_advantage_le_collisionBound` shows it suffices. -/

/-- **The factorization predicate suffices.** Supplying the adaptive→`signRunF` factorization
predicate `AdaptiveFactorizesSignRunF` discharges the salt-inclusive U2 against the adaptive game
runs: the total-variation distance between the real and programmed game runs is bounded by
`collisionBound Salt qSign qHash`.

The proof factors the runs through the predicate's `signRunF` presentation, applies the
data-processing inequality `tvDist_bind_right_le` to drop the shared post-processing `g`, and closes
with the unconditional salt-inclusive U2 `signRunF_tvDist_le_collisionBound`. Once the
deferred-sampling fold-level coupling establishes `AdaptiveFactorizesSignRunF`, the four GPV
theorems' sign-then-hash hop follows with no further probability content. -/

/-! ## Concrete GPV `signRunF` handlers

The predicate `AdaptiveFactorizesSignRunF` is an existential over a handler-state type `St`,
real/programmed per-step handlers, a recorded-cache sequence `c`, a start state, and a shared
post-processor `g`. This section pins the GPV-concrete witnesses for the handler-state and step
handlers, and proves the two *structural* conjuncts of the predicate against them — the `NeverFail`
of the real step and the off-collision branch agreement under regularity. The two run-equalities
`realRun = 𝒟[signRunF stepReal c qSign …]` / `progRun = 𝒟[signRunF stepProg c qSign …]` together
with the cache-growth bound on the *adaptive* run's recorded slices are the front-loading fold
factorization, established via `gpv_tvDist_tape_runs_le_collisionBound` below.

The handler state is the lazy random-oracle cache `(Salt × M →ₒ Range).QueryCache`; both step
handlers update it at the freshly drawn salt `r` and the `n`-th signing message `msgs n`. The
`stepReal` handler mirrors the real signing oracle's *cache-miss* branch: draw a uniform target
`c ← $ᵗ Range`, draw the trapdoor preimage, and cache `c`. The `stepProg` handler mirrors the
sign-then-hash simulator: forward-sample a short preimage `s ← domainSample pk` and program the
cache entry to `psf.eval pk s`. -/

total, the trapdoor draw is total by hypothesis, and the final cache update is a `pure`. This

/-- **Real/programmed GPV step distributional agreement.** Under PSF regularity (witnessed by the
forward sampler `domainSample` of `psf.Regularity`), the real and programmed per-step handlers agree
as output distributions at every step `n`, cache, and salt `r`.

Both handlers update the same cache slot `(r, msgs n)` with the first component of a `(target,
preimage)` pair; the real handler draws that pair as `(c, s)` with `c ← $ᵗ Range`, `s ←
trapdoorSample pk sk c`, while the programmed handler draws it as `(eval pk s, s)` with `s ←
domainSample pk`. PSF regularity equates exactly these two joint distributions, so projecting onto
the cache update preserves the equality. This agreement is in fact *unconditional* in `r` (it does
not require `r ∉ c n`), which is stronger than the obligation's off-collision conjunct demands. -/

/-- **Real GPV signing-body cache splice (cache-miss key).** One real signing-query body, run
through the lazy random oracle at a *missing* cache key `(r, msgs n)`, produces a recorded-cache
transition distributed exactly as the concrete `signRunF` real step `gpvStepReal` at the (already

The signing body queries the random oracle at `(r, msgs n)`; on the cache miss `cache (r, msgs n) =
none` the oracle draws a fresh uniform target `u ← $ᵗ Range`, records `(r, msgs n) ↦ u`, and returns
`u`; the body then draws the trapdoor preimage and yields the updated cache. The handler
`gpvStepReal` draws the same uniform target `c ← $ᵗ Range`, the same trapdoor preimage, and records
`(r, msgs n) ↦ c` — so the two recorded-cache distributions coincide. This is the *per-body splice*
of the adaptive→`signRunF` fold factorization (the signing-step case of
`gpv_tvDist_tape_runs_le_collisionBound`): it recasts one inline signing-oracle body, on a
fresh-salt cache miss, as the concrete `signRunF` real step, with the fresh salt `r` front-loaded
out of the body. It is *pinned* to the concrete `randomOracle` and `gpvStepReal`, requires only the

recorded random-oracle *cache component* (with the salt draw front-loaded, and the returned
