/-! ## Proof Decomposition

The EUF-CMA security proof proceeds by a game-hopping argument:

**Game 0**: The real EUF-CMA experiment with a lazy random oracle and the honest
signing oracle (trapdoor sampler).

**Game 1**: Replace signing with "sign-then-hash": for each signing query on message `m`,
sample a short preimage `s ← D_short`, set `c := psf.eval pk s`, program the RO at
`(r, m) := c`, and return `(r, s)`. This is indistinguishable from Game 0 when the PSF
sampler is correct (the output distribution conditioned on the target is the same).

**Bad event**: A fresh signing salt lands on a `(salt, message)` pair already recorded in the
random oracle, by a prior signing query or an adversary hash query. Under the birthday bound,
this happens with probability at most `(q_S + q_H)² / (2 · |Salt|)` (`collisionBound`).

**Game 2 (reduction)**: The simulator programs the random oracle with hidden short preimages.
If the adversary forges on a fresh `(salt, message)` pair and the forged short preimage differs
from the simulator's hidden programmed preimage at that point, the pair forms a collision under
`psf.eval`.

The exact-match branch, where the forgery reproduces the simulator's programmed preimage, is a
separate one-way/min-entropy obligation and is intentionally not encoded in the collision game
below.
-/

/-- The collision-branch GPV reduction adversary. Given a public key `pk`,
the reduction internally simulates the CMA experiment for the adversary:

1. Program a lazy random oracle, storing for each entry the hidden short preimage used to
   define that entry.
2. Answer signing queries using the sign-then-hash strategy: sample a short preimage
   `s` via `trapdoorSample`, compute `c = psf.eval pk s`, and program the RO at
   `(r, msg) := c`. Return `(r, s)` as the signature.
3. Run the adversary and, on a successful fresh forgery, return the simulator's hidden
   programmed preimage together with the forged preimage as a candidate collision.

The key insight is that in the sign-then-hash game, the reduction controls the entire
RO table. If the adversary forges on a fresh `(r*, msg*)` pair, the RO value at that
point was set by the reduction, so the hidden programmed preimage and the forged preimage
land at the same image under `psf.eval`.

The detailed construction simulates the adversary's oracle interactions by maintaining
a programmable RO state, using PSF correctness to ensure consistency. -/

/-- The salt-collision birthday bound, in the closed form `(qSign + qHash)² / (2 · |Salt|)`.

For `qSign` signing queries and `qHash` random-oracle queries, with salts drawn uniformly from a
set of size `|Salt|`, this bounds the probability that a fresh signing salt collides with any
previously recorded random-oracle input (a prior signing salt or an adversary hash query). What
the telescope actually establishes is the exact union sum `∑_{j < qSign} (j + qHash) / |Salt|`
(`sum_range_div_card_le_collisionBound`): the `j`-th fresh draw is compared against at most
`j + qHash` recorded entries, and `∑_{j < qSign} (j + qHash) = qSign·(qSign-1)/2 + qSign·qHash`
is at most `(qSign + qHash)² / 2`. This closed form is the constant the headline bounds state.

Relation to the literature: GPV08 (Proposition 6.2) only sketches the same-message salt reuse
term `Q_sign² / 2^k`; the salt-vs-hash-query accounting is the `Q_s · (C_s + Q_H) / 2^k` term of
[FGdG+25] Theorem 1, recorded in the umbrella module docstring. The closed form here is looser
than the union sum by the `qHash² / 2` term, which dominates when `qHash ≫ qSign`; at Falcon's
symmetric budget below the difference is immaterial.

For Falcon with 40-byte salts (`|Salt| = 2^320`) and `qSign, qHash ≤ 2^64`:
  `collisionBound (Bytes 40) (2^64) (2^64) = 2^130 / (2 · 2^320) = 2^{-191}`. -/

/-- The GPV salt-collision union bound (GPV08, Proposition 6.2), as a uniform-draw-hits-cache

If the random-oracle cache seen by the `j`-th signing query has size at most `j + qHash` (the `j`
prior signing salts plus the up to `qHash` adversary hash queries already recorded), then the
total probability that some fresh salt collides with a previously recorded entry is bounded by
`collisionBound`. The hypothesis `hcache` supplies the per-draw cache sizes `c j` together with
the bound `c j ≤ j + qHash`; the conclusion is the union bound over the `qSign` independent
uniform draws.

This is the real salt-collision event of the GPV proof (a fresh uniform draw hitting the
recorded random-oracle inputs), distinct from a hash-*output* collision over `|Range|`. -/

/-! ## Salt-averaged collision telescope (the combined draw-then-query step)

A per-query `withProgramming` union framework cannot see the GPV salt averaging: the programming bad
flag fires deterministically on a *fixed* query input `t = (r, m)`, while the collision randomness
lives in the fresh salt `r` drawn *inside* the signing oracle, one step *before* the random-oracle
query is issued. The right granularity is therefore a **combined "draw salt `r`, then check `r`
against the recorded inputs" step**, whose firing probability, *integrated over the uniform salt
draw*, is `card cache / |Salt|`.

`saltSeq` is exactly this combined-step process abstracted away from the oracle plumbing: it
draws `qSign` fresh salts in sequence and reports whether any draw `r_j` lands in the recorded
set `c j` seen by the `j`-th signing query. `probEvent_saltSeq_le` telescopes the per-draw
collision probabilities (each a `probEvent_mem_uniformSample` instance) into the running sum
`∑_{j < qSign} card (c j) / |Salt|`, and `probEvent_saltSeq_le_collisionBound` finishes with the
Gauss-sum estimate `sum_range_div_card_le_collisionBound`. This is the salt-AVERAGED step bound
matching the granularity of the fresh salt draw. -/

/-- The combined draw-then-collision-check process underlying the GPV salt-collision union bound.

`saltSeq c n` draws `n` fresh uniform salts in sequence; the `j`-th draw `r_j` is checked for
membership in the recorded random-oracle input set `c j` (the salts and hash inputs seen by the
`j`-th signing query). It returns `true` iff some draw collides with its recorded set. This is the
salt-averaged abstraction of "draw a fresh signing salt, then query the random oracle at it":
firing is integrated over the fresh draw rather than evaluated at a fixed query input. -/

`card (c n) / |Salt|` (one `probEvent_mem_uniformSample` instance, integrated over the fresh salt),

`probEvent_bind_le_add` on the monotone Boolean disjunction. Unlike a fixed-`t` `withProgramming`
step (which fires deterministically and cannot be capped below `1`), every step here is averaged
over its own fresh salt draw, so the small `card / |Salt|` cap is honest. -/

/-! ## The salt-collision coupling and the hash-only granularity

The salt-averaged telescope above (`probEvent_saltSeq_le_collisionBound`) is the axiom-clean bound
on the GPV salt-collision event: a sequence of `qSign` fresh uniform salt draws, the `j`-th checked
against the recorded inputs `c j` of size `≤ j + qHash`, collides with probability at most
`collisionBound Salt qSign qHash`. This is the salt-AVERAGED combined "draw salt, then check" step
that a per-query `withProgramming` framework cannot express.

The `withProgramming` fire-on-miss bad event bounded by the U2 core
`tvDist_runtime_real_programmed_le_bad` cannot be supplied from this telescope at that statement's
granularity, for two independent structural reasons:

1. **Wrong event.** That bad event is the `withProgramming` *bad flag*, which fires on a
   cache-*miss* whose query input lies in the programming policy's support
   (`cache t = none ∧ policy t = some v`; see `QueryImpl.withProgramming`). For the GPV simulator
   policy (which programs at every fresh signing point) this fires *deterministically* once an
   uncached signing point is reached, so its probability is near `1`, not `collisionBound`. The
   salt-collision event of the telescope is the opposite: a fresh salt *hitting* an
   already-recorded entry (a cache *hit* at a programmed point), which the monotone fire-on-miss
   flag does not record.

2. **Invisible salt draws.** That bad event is phrased over `ob : OracleComp (Salt × M →ₒ Range)`, a
   random-oracle-only computation. The GPV signing salts are drawn in `unifSpec`/`ProbComp`, i.e.
   *outside* the `(Salt × M →ₒ Range)` spec, one step before each random-oracle query. By the time a
   query input `(r, m)` reaches the `withProgramming` handler the salt `r` is already a fixed value,
   so the `card / |Salt|` averaging that the telescope performs over the fresh draw is structurally
   absent from `ob`'s granularity.

The U2 *re-statement* `tvDist_runtime_real_programmed_le_collisionBound_saltInclusive` (below)
states U2 over the salt-inclusive signing run with the bad event instrumented as the cache-HIT salt
collision `saltSeq c qSign`, and discharges the loss-free `tvDist ≤ collisionBound.toReal`
conclusion *given* the up-to-bad coupling
`hcouple : tvDist(real, programmed) ≤ Pr[saltSeq c qSign = true]`. It does **not** route through the
fire-on-miss bad event (which, per reason 1 above, would require the false inequality
"fire-on-miss ≤ salt-collision").  The GPV-instantiated Step-1 hop actually consumed by the headline
bounds is `gpv_tvDist_real_programmed_le_collisionBound`, which is unconditional over the pinned
game runs; the salt-inclusive re-statement is its hash-only surface analogue.

The coupling `hcouple` is the identical-until-bad coupling between the real GPV run (lazy random
oracle, fresh uniform answer at each `(r, m)`) and the programmed run (answer `psf.eval pk s`),
whose only divergence is a fresh signing salt colliding with a recorded cache slice — precisely the
`saltSeq` event. It is a joint distribution over the interleaved `unifSpec` salt-draw /
`(Salt × M →ₒ Range)` random-oracle-query streams of the salt-inclusive signing program, and is
established below over the salt-inclusive vehicle `signRunF` — where the salt draws are explicit —
rather than at the hash-only `ob` interface where they are invisible (reason 2). -/

/-! ## Salt-inclusive identical-until-bad coupling primitives

The coupling is built on a *salt-inclusive* signing process `signRunF`, where the salt draws are
explicit and the salt-collision averaging is structurally visible. This section establishes the
identical-until-bad primitives for that process.

`tvDist_signStep_real_programmed_le_collision` is the per-step core: a single combined "draw a fresh
salt `r`, then answer" step, where the *real* branch answers with the lazy random-oracle value and
the *programmed* branch answers with the regularity-supplied value. Off the per-step salt collision
`r ∈ cache`, regularity makes the two answer branches agree in distribution (`h_eq`), so the
total-variation distance of the combined step is bounded by exactly the salt collision probability
`card cache / |Salt|`. This is the single-step instance of the fundamental-lemma-of-game-playing,
with the bad event averaged over the fresh salt draw. It specializes
`tvDist_bind_left_event_le`.

`signRunF` is the flag-carrying sequenced signing process: it draws `qSign` fresh salts in turn,
applies a per-step answer handler `step n state r`, and sets a Boolean flag the first time a drawn
salt lands in its recorded cache slice `c n`. Its flag-true marginal is the run-level counterpart of
the `saltSeq` collision event: the flag fires iff some draw collides, which is exactly the
`saltSeq` disjunction marginalized over the threaded state.

`signRunF_tvDist_le_saltSeq` is the multi-step coupling: the total-variation distance between the
real and programmed sequenced runs is bounded by `Pr[saltSeq c qSign = true]`. Off the per-step
collision the *current* step distributions agree (via `h_step`), but the two runs recurse with
*different* per-step handlers, so the off-bad agreement is threaded through the recursion with the
accumulating flag rather than obtained by a single application of the per-step primitive (the tails
differ). Chaining it with the telescope `probEvent_saltSeq_le_collisionBound` yields the
salt-inclusive coupling `signRunF_tvDist_le_collisionBound`. -/

/-- **Per-step salt-inclusive identical-until-bad coupling.**

A single combined "draw a fresh salt `r`, then answer" step. The *real* answer branch `freal r` and
the *programmed* answer branch `fprog r` are coupled through the shared fresh salt draw. Off the
per-step salt collision `r ∈ cache`, regularity guarantees the two answer branches agree in
distribution (`h_eq`), so the total-variation distance of the combined step is bounded by the
probability that the fresh salt lands in `cache`, namely `card cache / |Salt|` (via
`probEvent_mem_uniformSample`).

This is the single-step instance of the fundamental-lemma-of-game-playing with the bad event
averaged over the fresh salt draw. It specializes `tvDist_bind_left_event_le` at
`mx := $ᵗ Salt` and `bad := (· ∈ cache)`. It is the per-step core the sequenced coupling
`signRunF_tvDist_le_saltSeq` accumulates. -/

`signRunF step c n` runs `n` combined signing steps over a threaded state `St × Bool`. At step `j`
it draws a fresh salt `r ← $ᵗ Salt`, advances the state by the per-step handler `step j state r`,
and records in the Boolean flag whether `r` landed in the recorded cache slice `c j`. The flag is
monotone (set once a collision occurs), so its final value is the run-level salt-collision event —
the salt-inclusive, state-threaded counterpart of the salt-averaged `saltSeq` process. -/

/-- **Stateful identical-until-bad telescoping (generalized over the initial flag and state).**

This is the inductive heart of the salt-inclusive coupling. For any initial flag `b` and state
`st`, the total-variation distance between the real and programmed sequenced runs is bounded by the
salt-averaged collision probability `Pr[saltSeq c n = true]`, *independently of `b` and `st`* (the
flag only accumulates the collision disjunction and the RHS does not depend on the threaded state).

The successor step shares the fresh salt draw `r ← $ᵗ Salt` and splits per-`r`:
* On the per-step collision `r ∈ c n` the step is charged its full mass (`tvDist ≤ 1`), contributing
  the head term `card (c n) / |Salt|`.
* Off the collision (`r ∉ c n`) the head handlers agree in distribution (`h_step`), so by the
  triangle inequality the step contributes only the tail, bounded by the induction hypothesis at the
  advanced state and flag. The `NeverFail` hypothesis keeps the state-marginal mass equal to one.

The per-`r` charges accumulate to exactly `card (c n) / |Salt| + (1 - card (c n) / |Salt|) ·
Pr[saltSeq c n]`, which equals `Pr[saltSeq c (n + 1)]` by the independence identity
`probEvent_saltSeq_succ`. This realizes design L3a: a stateful telescoping accepting
state-dependent per-step costs. -/

/-- **Salt-inclusive identical-until-bad coupling.**

The total-variation distance between the real sequenced signing run `signRunF stepReal c n` and the
programmed sequenced signing run `signRunF stepProg c n` is bounded by the salt-averaged collision
probability `Pr[saltSeq c n = true]`, provided the two per-step handlers agree in distribution off
the per-step salt collision `r ∈ c j` (`h_step`, supplied for GPV by regularity `hreg`). The
`NeverFail` hypothesis on the real handler keeps probability mass during the state marginalization.

This is the multi-step joint coupling, threaded through the recursion by
`signRunF_tvDist_le_saltSeq_aux` (the generalization over the initial flag and state). It decomposes
into two parts:

* **Per-step charge.** Off `r ∈ c j` the two combined "draw salt, then answer" steps agree in
  distribution, so each step contributes only its salt-collision mass `card (c j) / |Salt|`. This is
  the per-step primitive `tvDist_signStep_real_programmed_le_collision`, applied per fibre
  via `tvDist_bind_le_of_forall_le`.
* **Accumulation to `saltSeq`.** The per-step charges accumulate along the recursion to the
  run-level collision-flag probability, which equals the salt-averaged `saltSeq` disjunction once
  the threaded state is marginalized out — the inclusion-exclusion identity
  `probEvent_saltSeq_succ`.

Chaining this result with the telescope `probEvent_saltSeq_le_collisionBound`
(`Pr[saltSeq] ≤ collisionBound`) yields the salt-inclusive coupling that discharges the U2
hypothesis `hcouple`, once the GPV reduction handlers and per-step caches `c j` are instantiated. -/

/-- **U2, re-stated over the salt-inclusive signing run (unconditional).**

This is the salt-inclusive U2: it bounds the total-variation distance between the real and
programmed *signing runs* directly by `collisionBound`, with **no coupling hypothesis**. Unlike the
hash-only `tvDist_runtime_real_programmed_le_collisionBound_saltInclusive` (which takes the coupling
as the typed hypothesis `hcouple`), this lemma is phrased over the salt-inclusive vehicle
`signRunF` — where each of the `qSign` fresh signing salts `r ← $ᵗ Salt` is an explicit step of the
recursion — so the salt-collision averaging is *structurally visible* and the coupling discharges it
outright.

The proof chains two results with no loss:
* the multi-step coupling `signRunF_tvDist_le_saltSeq`
  (`tvDist (signRunF stepReal …) (signRunF stepProg …) ≤ Pr[saltSeq c qSign = true]`), and
* the salt-averaged telescope `probEvent_saltSeq_le_collisionBound`
  (`Pr[saltSeq c qSign = true] ≤ collisionBound Salt qSign qHash`),
moved to `ℝ` by `ENNReal.toReal_mono` (using `collisionBound < ⊤`).

`stepReal`/`stepProg` are the per-signing-step answer handlers (real lazy random oracle vs the
regularity-supplied programmed answer); `h_step` is the off-collision branch agreement supplied by
PSF regularity (`psf.Regularity`); `c j` is the recorded random-oracle cache slice seen by the
`j`-th signing query, with the standard growth bound `card (c j) ≤ j + qHash` (`hcache`).

Feeding the four GPV theorems additionally requires the adaptive→`signRunF` factorization: matching
the real adversary run `simulateQ impl (adv.main pk)` — which interleaves the `qSign` signing
queries (each drawing a fresh salt) with up to `qHash` adversary hash queries *adaptively* — to this
fixed `qSign`-step `signRunF` recursion. That factorization is the deferred-sampling joint coupling
packaged as `AdaptiveFactorizesSignRunF` (see the *Adaptive→signRunF factorization* section
below). -/
