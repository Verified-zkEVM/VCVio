# Address-key specialization of the generic Merkle transcript extractor

This module does not define a second extraction recurrence. It specializes
`MerkleTreeExtractor` to `NodeQuery Address Y`, retaining the caller's actual oracle address type
and an explicit map from typed skeleton positions to those keys. In particular, a caller may use
`Address := PkSeed × AdrsKey` for an SLH-DSA `Thash` oracle query; the public seed is then part of
query identity exactly as it is in `PublicHashQuery.thash`.

The pure recovery theorem is inherited from the shared generic owner. A probabilistic theorem over
a heterogeneous super-oracle still requires a proved projection of that oracle's transcript onto
this homogeneous node-query log; no direct identification of those log types is made here.
