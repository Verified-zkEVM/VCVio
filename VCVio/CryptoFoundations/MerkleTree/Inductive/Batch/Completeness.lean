# Completeness of Batch Openings for Inductive Merkle Trees

This file proves the completeness theorem for the batch openings defined in
`VCVio.CryptoFoundations.MerkleTree.Inductive.Batch.Defs`: an honestly generated batch proof,
together with the true values of the selected leaves, recomputes exactly the root of the
honestly built Merkle tree — for *every* selector that opens at least one leaf.

As with the single-index case, the proof is split into two pieces:

* `InductiveMerkleTree.functional_batch_completeness` is a purely functional statement about
  `getPutativeBatchRootWithHash` and `buildMerkleTreeWithHash`, proven by induction on the
  leaf data with the selector case-split at each internal node (both children selected /
  right pruned / left pruned).
* `InductiveMerkleTree.batch_completeness` lifts the functional statement to the monadic API
  under the random oracle, reducing through `simulateQ` exactly as the single-index
  `completeness` theorem does.

A functional form of the batch completeness theorem: the honest batch proof generated from
an honestly built tree, together with the true selected leaf values, recomputes the tree's
root — under any hash function and any selector opening at least one leaf.

Batch completeness theorem for Merkle trees: building the tree honestly, generating the
batch proof for any selector opening at least one leaf, and verifying it against the tree's
root succeeds with probability `1` under the random oracle.

The proof reduces to `functional_batch_completeness` through `simulateQ`, exactly as the
single-index `completeness` theorem reduces to `functional_completeness`.
