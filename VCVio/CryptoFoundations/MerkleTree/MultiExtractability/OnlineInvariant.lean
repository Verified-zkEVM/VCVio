# Online Stability Invariant for Stateful Merkle Extraction

The predictable-target stopping theorem needs a semantic good-state invariant. `StableAt` says
that every immutable checkpoint still extracts the same partial tree at the current cumulative
log. It is true initially, is preserved by re-querying a cached entry, and is preserved by a fresh
response outside the live target union computed before that response was sampled. At a phase
boundary, recording the newly emitted root establishes stability for the new checkpoint as well.
