# Shared Target Sets for Stateful Merkle Extraction

This module gives semantic content to the shared target count used by multi-extractability
potentials. It flattens the labels reached by every heterogeneous commitment checkpoint into one
finite set. Two independent bounds are proved:

* the set contains no more labels than the sum of the checkpoint tree-node budgets;
* when all checkpoint logs are prefixes of one cache-backed cumulative log, the set contains at
  most two children per populated query key plus one root per checkpoint.

The combined result is the minimum of those two bounds. Duplicated labels across checkpoints are
deduplicated by `Finset`, so the result accounts for a genuine shared target union rather than a
sum of per-checkpoint target counts.
