# EUF-CMA for Fiat-Shamir with aborts: ReadRecording

The read-recording handler `deferredDrawReadImpl`: the deferred-draw run's
read-time bad flag is dominated by the final-state predicate "some recorded
read-commit is in the final drawn list".

Part of the CMA-to-NMA security development for the Fiat-Shamir-with-aborts
transform; `VCVio.CryptoFoundations.FiatShamir.WithAbort.Security` re-exports
all of its modules and holds the overview docstring.

/-! ### Read-recording handler: bad as a final-state predicate

The deferred-draw run's bad flag is set at *read time*: a read fires when its target commitment is
in the drawn list **as it stands at that read**. Because the drawn list only grows
(`deferredDraw_run_drawn_prefix`), a read that hits the drawn-so-far list certainly hits the *final*
drawn list, so the bad event is dominated by the final-state predicate "some recorded read-commit
is in the final drawn list". The handler `deferredDrawReadImpl` records, in an extra `List Commit`
component, the commitment `mc.2` of every adversarial read; its read step is otherwise identical to
`deferredDrawImpl` (same answer via `roStep`, same drawn list, same bad flag). The reduction
`deferredDraw_bad_le_readRecord` is the pointwise coupling that reads the bad ordering off the run;
it converts the *read-time* bad flag into the *final-state* membership predicate
`∃ rc ∈ readlist, rc ∈ drawnlist`, which removes the read-time/final-state mismatch that obstructs a
direct expectation bound. The recorded read commits are **value-free** (answers come from the real
layer via `roStep`; the drawn *values* never feed the read points), which is what
`Security/TapeFactorization.lean` charges against the recorded draws.

Why a bespoke handler rather than generic query instrumentation. The framework's generic
`QueryImpl` decorations (`withLogging`, `withTrace`/`withTraceBefore`, and cursor/path-style
wrappers) instrument *occurrences of queries in the computation being simulated*: they observe the
query's input, and optionally its answer, at each node of the original tree. That is enough for the
read half of the state here — the adversary's random-oracle reads *are* nodes of `adv.main pk`, so
their commitment components could be logged generically. It is not enough for the draw half. The
commitment draws being recorded are not occurrences in the adversary's tree at all: they are
introduced *inside the signing handler*, by `ghostSignDrawBody`, when the handler answers a signing
query, and their number is itself random (one per rejected attempt). No input-only instrumentation
of the adversary's queries can name them, so the drawn list has to be a component of the handler's
own state, written by the signing branch. Recording both lists in one handler state is also what
makes the pair `(readlist, drawnlist)` available at a single final state, which is the form the
first-moment charge consumes. -/

/-- State of the read-recording deferred-draw handler: the underlying `DeferredState` together with
the accumulated list of commitment components `mc.2` of every adversarial random-oracle read. The
extra list makes the read-hit event a *final-state* predicate (membership in the drawn list) rather
than a read-time flag. -/

and whenever the deferred bad flag is set there is a recorded read-commit already in the deferred

witnessed by a recorded read-commit lying in the *current* (hence final) drawn list. -/

* **Read** answers from the shared real layer via `roStep` (same answer, same cache, same drawn
  list); the recorded read-commit `mc.2` witnesses any newly-set bad flag (it is appended to the
  read-commit list and, when the flag fires, lies in the drawn list).
* **Sign** runs the shared `ghostSignDrawBody`; the drawn list grows in lockstep, so an existing
  read-commit witness is preserved (the drawn list only appends). -/

This is the elementary first-moment (Markov) step of the per-position route: a firing run has at
least one coincidence, so the indicator of the firing event is dominated by the (nonnegative,
integer-valued) coincidence count, and `Pr[fire] ≤ E[count]` by the Markov core
`probEvent_le_tsum_probOutput_mul_cost`. The probabilistic content — bounding `E[count]` by
`(qH+1)·ε·E[#attempts]` — is the per-position independence of each fresh draw from the
