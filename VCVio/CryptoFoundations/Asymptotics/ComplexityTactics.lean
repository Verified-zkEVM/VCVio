# Conservative polynomial-time proof lookup

This module provides a deliberately small automation surface for polynomial-time proofs.
`@[ppt_primitive]` accepts only concrete value declarations returning a PolyFun `PolyRealizer`, or
theorems concluding VCVio's backend-relative `IsOraclePPTBy`. (`PolyRealizer` lives in `Type`, so it
cannot itself be the conclusion of a Lean `theorem`.) The `ppt` tactic closes a goal only with a
definitionally exact local assumption or a registered declaration that elaborates as an exact
term of the whole goal.

There is intentionally no simp set, recursive theorem application, or generic proof search here.
In particular, registration does not make a semantic function executable and `ppt` never invents
a realizer. Later compositional automation can grow from PolyFun's explicit polynomial-category
and structural mixins without weakening this trusted primitive boundary.

The registry uses two literal result-head buckets rather than `Sym.Pattern`: there are only two
accepted heads, and Sym's declaration preprocessing would unfold the reducible `IsOraclePPTBy`
surface to its `Nonempty` implementation. Every bucket candidate is still checked by exact term
elaboration, so head lookup is only a bounded selector and never establishes a proof.
