# Cost-Aware Security Reductions

This file packages the cost-transform part of a reduction theorem.

`ReductionWithCost` records:

- a reduction `reduce : Adv → Adv'`,
- a monotone transform on asymptotic cost bounds,
- a proof that the reduced adversary's cost profile is bounded by that transform.

This is intentionally abstract in both the choice of efficiency class and the shape of the cost
objects being transformed. Users can instantiate the resulting meta-theorems with scalar costs,
structured resource profiles, interface-profile bounds, or any other preordered asymptotic notion
that is closed under the transform carried by the reduction.

/-- Cost-aware security reduction.

If a reduction preserves advantage, and if the target efficiency class is closed under the
reduction's cost transform, then security of the target game implies security of the source game
for adversaries whose cost profiles lie in the source class. -/
