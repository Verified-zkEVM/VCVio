# Tweakable Hash Families

A tweakable hash family `Th : PkSeed → Tweak → M → Y` generalizes `KeyedHashFamily` by
splitting the key into a *sampled* public seed and a *caller-supplied* abstract tweak. It is the
abstraction that the SLH-DSA / SPHINCS+ functions `F`, `H`, and `T_ℓ` instantiate (with the
tweak being the 32-byte address `ADRS`), and against which their multi-target security notions
(`VCVio.CryptoFoundations.HardnessAssumptions.MultiTarget`) are stated.

This file provides the data abstraction only; the security games live in `MultiTarget` and are
deliberately stated over plain functions `X → Y` / `Tweak → M → Y`, so a partially-applied
tweakable hash can be fed in without a circular dependency.

With `Tweak := Unit` this is definitionally a keyed hash family
(`seedGen : ProbComp PkSeed`, `eval : PkSeed → M → Y`), so nothing is lost relative to the
existing `KeyedHashFamily` surface.
