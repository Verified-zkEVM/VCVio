# The collection oracle for the single-function, distinct-tweak, multi-target games

A reduction attacking one member of a tweakable-hash family must still evaluate members of that
family to simulate the rest of the structure — SLH-DSA's `F`, `H` and `T_ℓ` share one public seed
and one address space — and cannot do so once the seed is withheld from it. This oracle is that
access.

Which members it covers is fixed at instantiation, not here. `TweakableHashCollection.cons` puts the
attacked member in the collection, so this oracle also evaluates it at tweaks that are not targets;
that case is HK22's `Th_m ∈ Th_λ`, and a reduction against SLH-DSA needs it, since only a handful of
the addresses at which `F` runs are targets.

The collection is a parameter of each problem rather than a second game beside it. The stand-alone
notion is the instance at the empty collection (`TweakableHashCollection.empty`), where the query
type is uninhabited — pinned by `isEmpty_domain_collectionSpec_empty`; the games' `standalone`
constructors package that instantiation.

The target/challenge tweaks must be distinct from each other and from every tweak submitted to the
collection oracle. The original proofs enforce that in the winning condition; here the oracles
enforce it. Specifically, the collection oracle rejects any tweak already in the challenge history,
and each game's challenge oracle rejects a tweak already in its own or the collection oracle's
history. The two admit the same winning adversaries: a violating transcript loses on the winning
condition, and a rejected query yields `⊥` and no information. Enforcing it in the oracles makes the
restriction unviolatable rather than a side condition.

/-! ## The tweak discipline

Both oracles test a queried tweak against the two histories, and the predicates below are that test.
`Q` is the type of one recorded challenge query and `tweakOf` reads its tweak, so neither predicate
— nor `collectionOracle`, which uses the first of them — fixes the rest of a query's shape. SM-TCR
records `Tweak × M` and SM-PRE records `Tweak × M'`, both at `tweakOf := Prod.fst`; a game whose
history is tweaks alone takes `Q := Tweak` and `tweakOf := id`. -/

/-- The tweak `t` is reserved by the challenge oracle: it already occurs in the challenge history.
This is what `collectionOracle` rejects on. -/

    Decidable (TweakReserved tweakOf qsChal t) :=

/-- `t` is fresh for both histories: unreserved by the challenge oracle, and unspent on the
collection oracle. This is what each game's challenge oracle requires of a query, beyond its own
target cap. -/

/-! ## The oracle -/

/-- The collection oracle's signature: a query names a member `i`, a tweak, and a message of *that
member's* type, and the response is `Option Y`, with `none` the rejection of a tweak reserved by the
challenge oracle. -/
abbrev collectionSpec (thColl : TweakableHashCollection ι PkSeed Tweak Y) :
    OracleSpec ((i : ι) × Tweak × thColl.Msg i) :=
  _ →ₒ Option Y

/-- The collection oracle at a public seed, over the two-part game state
`(challenge history, collection tweaks)`.

A query is rejected with `none` exactly when its tweak is reserved by the challenge oracle; the
state is then untouched. Otherwise the answer is the queried member evaluated at the game's seed,
and the tweak is appended to the collection tweak list. Repeated collection tweaks are accepted.

The challenge history is a list of `Q`, read only through `tweakOf`, so a game records whatever its
winning condition needs — `Tweak × M` for SM-TCR, `Tweak × M'` for SM-PRE, `Tweak` alone for a game
that needs no payload — and this oracle is unchanged by the choice. -/

    else
      set (qsChal, twsColl ++ [q.2.1])
      return some (thColl.eval q.1 pk q.2.1 q.2.2)

/-- At the empty collection (`ι := Empty`) the oracle's query type is uninhabited, so a game
instantiated there cannot issue a collection query at all. This is what makes the stand-alone notion
recovered rather than merely approximated, so it is pinned rather than asserted. -/

/-- A collection query at a tweak the challenge oracle has already issued is rejected, and the state

game's challenge oracle rejecting a tweak already in the collection list. -/

/-- Repeating a collection tweak is **accepted**: querying the same tweak twice in a row is answered
both times, and both occurrences are appended. Only disjointness from the target tweaks is required,
not distinctness among the collection tweaks themselves, and a reduction may legitimately evaluate
one address more than once.

Stated over two consecutive queries rather than one, because the single-query statement is a
corollary of `collectionOracle_run_of_fresh` and so would still hold if the oracle grew a
self-distinctness check. This form fails outright if it does, and it fixes the append order at the
same time. -/
