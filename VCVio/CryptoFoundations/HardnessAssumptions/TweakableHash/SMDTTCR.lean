# Single-function, distinct-tweak, multi-target target-collision resistance (SM-DT-TCR)

The adversary first selects up to `numTargets` targets through an oracle evaluating the tweakable
hash at a public seed it does not know, then learns the seed and must collide with one of the images
it received. It may evaluate the other members of the collection throughout, through
`collectionOracle`.

Shortened to `SM-TCR` in the prose below; the declaration names keep the full label.

The seed is sampled by `SM_DT_TCR_Experiment` and passed only to `SM_DT_TCR_Adversary.forge`; it
never reaches `SM_DT_TCR_Adversary.choose`. The two phases are separate fields at different types,
`OracleComp (SM_DT_TCR_challengeSpec …)` against `ProbComp`, so "the oracle is removed once the seed
is revealed" is a typing fact and not a runtime convention: `forge` has no oracle to query.

`numTargets` bounds the accepted challenge queries and is the only query bound the game carries. See
`TweakableHash.collectionOracle` for why the tweak restrictions are enforced in the oracles rather
than in the winning condition.

target cap is reached, when its tweak already occurs in the challenge history, or when its tweak has
been spent on the collection oracle; a rejected query leaves the state untouched.

Accepted queries are appended, so the history is in issue order and its `j`-th entry is the `j`-th
target. -/

/-! ## Pinning the challenge oracle's conventions

A kernel-debt gate cannot see a game that disagrees with the paper. The lemmas below fix the four
branches of `SM_DT_TCR_challengeOracle` and the order of the history, so that a change of convention
breaks a proof rather than passing silently. -/
