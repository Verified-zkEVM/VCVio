# Single-function, distinct-tweak, multi-target target-collision resistance (SM-DT-TCR)

The adversary first selects up to `numTargets` targets through an oracle evaluating the tweakable
hash at a public seed it does not know, then learns the seed and must collide with one of the images
it received. It may evaluate the other members of the collection throughout, through
`collectionOracle`.

Shortened to `SM-TCR` in the prose below; the declaration names keep the full label.

The seed is sampled by `SM_DT_TCR_Experiment` and passed only to `SM_DT_TCR_Adversary.forge`; it
never reaches `SM_DT_TCR_Adversary.choose`. The two phases are separate fields at different types,
`OracleComp (SM_DT_TCR_challengeSpec …)` against `ProbComp`, so "the oracle is removed once the seed
is revealed" is a typing fact and not a runtime convention: `forge` has no oracle to query.

All challenge and collection queries are answered and recorded. `numTargets`, distinct target
tweaks, and target/collection disjointness are enforced by a sticky final-validity bit: a violating
query poisons the bit but is not rejected. This is equivalent to the EasyCrypt/BDHMS final-predicate
presentation and is intentionally distinct from rejection-on-arrival.
