# Hard Relations

This file defines a typeclass `HardRelation X W r` for relations `r : X → W → Prop`
that are "hard" in the sense that given `x : X` no polynomial adversary can find `w : W`
such that `r x w` holds.

In the actual implementation all of these are indexed by some security parameter.

## Implementation notes

This is a simplified version without the asymptotic security parameter framework.
A full asymptotic version needs `OracleAlg` to be redesigned.
