# One-Way Functions and Trapdoor Permutations

This file defines one-way functions (OWFs) and one-way trapdoor permutations (OW-TDPs),
along with their security experiments.

## One-Way Functions

A function `f : X → Y` is one-way if no efficient adversary, given `f(x)` for a random `x`,
can find any preimage `x'` with `f(x') = f(x)`.

## Trapdoor Permutations

A trapdoor permutation has a key generation algorithm that produces a public key `pk`
and a secret key `sk`. The forward direction `f(pk, ·)` is a permutation that is hard to
invert given only `pk`; the secret key enables efficient inversion via `f⁻¹(sk, ·)`.

## Main Definitions

- `OWFAdversary X Y` — an adversary trying to invert `f`.
- `owfExp` — the one-wayness experiment.
- `TrapdoorPermutation PK SK X` — a trapdoor permutation scheme.
- `TDPAdversary PK X` — an adversary trying to invert the TDP.
- `tdpExp` — the TDP inversion experiment.
