# Security-parameter families as one syntactic interaction

Cryptographic definitions are commonly presented as a family of computations indexed by a
security parameter. Such a family is only a semantic presentation: allowing an unrelated
implementation at every index would make a purported polynomial-time witness nonuniform.

This module packages an indexed family into one `OracleComp` over the sigma of its interfaces.
The packed computation receives the security parameter as ordinary input, tags every query with
that parameter, and tags its result with the same parameter. A quantitative realization of the
packed program is therefore one implementation of the whole family.

The construction is entirely syntactic. It specializes PolyFun's generic `FreeM.sigmaInj` and
`FreeM.packFamily` operations to `Nat`-indexed `OracleComp` families, preserving the original
query tree and all typed answer paths. This file deliberately does not select an encoding of
`Nat`; a concrete complexity backend must pin one explicitly (normally unary for a cryptographic
security parameter).
