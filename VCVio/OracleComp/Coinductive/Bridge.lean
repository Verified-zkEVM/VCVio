/-! # Bridge between `OracleComp` and `ITree`

`OracleComp spec α` is the *inductive* free monad on `spec.toPFunctor`;
`ITree spec.toPFunctor α` is the *coinductive* (M-type) free monad on the
same polynomial functor. Every finite, terminating `OracleComp` program has
a canonical embedding into the (potentially-infinite) ITree world.

This module provides that embedding, `OracleComp.toITree`, together with the
structural simp lemmas (`toITree_pure`, `toITree_queryBind`) that compute it.

The reverse map "ITree-to-OracleComp" exists *only* on terminating ITrees
and requires productivity / well-foundedness arguments that are not yet
in scope; hence we provide only the forward direction here.

## Universe restriction

To keep the polynomial functor uniform-universe, we specialise to
`OracleSpec.{u, u} ι`. The general `OracleSpec.{u, v}` case would force
`Poly F α` to live in `Type (max u v + 1)`, which is at odds with our
single-universe ITree definition.

universe u

namespace OracleComp

variable {ι : Type u} {spec : OracleSpec.{u, u} ι} {α β : Type u}

/-- Embed an `OracleComp spec α` into the corresponding `ITree`. Each `pure x`
becomes `ITree.pure x`; each `queryBind t k` becomes `ITree.query t (toITree ∘ k)`.
The recursion is structural on `OracleComp` (which is an inductive free monad),
so productivity is automatic. -/
