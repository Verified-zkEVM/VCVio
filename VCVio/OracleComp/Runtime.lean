/-! # Persistent oracle runtimes

A runtime initializes its state once, then interprets surface computations sequentially.
Run results keep each output together with its final state and ordered surface query log.
The carrier does not certify provenance: `OracleRuntime.GeneratedBy` records membership in
an actual runner's support. Import queries made by setup or handlers are not surface queries.
This interface uses small types, as do the sequential query-logging laws.
