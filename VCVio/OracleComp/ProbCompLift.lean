# Bundled Lifts from `ProbComp`

This file packages the "public randomness" capability separately from denotational semantics.

Many crypto constructions need two orthogonal pieces of structure on their ambient monad `m`:

1. a way to *observe* computations probabilistically (`SPMFSemantics` / `PMFSemantics`)
2. a way to *inject* plain probabilistic sampling into `m`

This file packages the second capability as a bundled monad homomorphism `ProbComp →ᵐ m`, so it
can be carried independently of whatever denotational semantics the construction uses. It also
defines `ProbCompRuntime`, the common crypto-facing bundle that pairs public-randomness lifting
with bundled `SPMF` semantics for an ambient monad.

/-- Bundled way to lift plain probabilistic computations into an ambient monad `m`.

Intuitively, this is the capability "sample fresh public randomness inside `m`". We package it as
a monad homomorphism so it composes lawfully with `pure` and `bind`. -/

  /-- Inject a plain `ProbComp` computation into `m`. -/
  liftProbComp : ProbComp →ᵐ m

/-- Common runtime bundle for crypto games in an ambient monad `m`.

This packages the two capabilities that security experiments usually need together:

1. `SPMFSemantics m` to observe the experiment as a Boolean subdistribution.
2. `ProbCompLift m` to sample fresh public randomness inside `m`.

The bundle is kept separate from the core scheme definitions so that executable scheme data does
not become noncomputable merely by carrying denotational semantics. -/
