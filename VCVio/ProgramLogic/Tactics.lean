# VCGen Tactics for Probabilistic Program Logic

This is the canonical user-facing umbrella import for tactic-based program-logic proofs.

- `VCVio.ProgramLogic.Tactics.Unary` contains unary / quantitative tactics such as
  `vcstep`, `vcgen`, `exp_norm`, and `by_hoare`.
- `VCVio.ProgramLogic.Tactics.Relational` contains relational proof-mode tactics such as
  `rvcstep`, `rvcgen`, `by_equiv`, `rel_dist`, `game_trans`, `by_dist`, and `by_upto`.

For probability equalities, use `vcstep` directly:
- plain `vcstep` keeps the heuristic swap/congruence dispatcher;
- `vcstep rw` / `vcstep rw under n` expose explicit bind-swap rewrites;
- `vcstep rw congr` / `vcstep rw congr'` expose one shared bind explicitly.

For unary theorem-driven steps:
- `vcstep with thm` forces one explicit unary theorem/assumption step;
- `@[vcspec]` registers an explicit opt-in theorem for bounded lookup by
  `vcstep` / `vcgen` / `rvcstep` / `rvcgen`.

For tactic-choice debugging, enable `set_option vcvio.vcgen.traceSteps true`.

For normal proof work, import `VCVio.ProgramLogic.Tactics` and treat it as the default
interactive tactic surface.
