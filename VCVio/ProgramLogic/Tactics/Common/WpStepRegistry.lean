# `@[wpStep]` Registry

Discrimination-tree backed registry for the equational `wp comp post = …`
rewrites used by the inner driver of `vcstep` / `vcgen` for raw `wp`-shaped
goals.

Each `@[wpStep]` rule is compiled once, at attribute-registration time, into
a `Sym.Pattern` keyed on just the `comp` argument of the LHS
(`Sym.mkPatternFromDeclWithKey`). That pattern lives in a `Sym.DiscrTree` so
a goal `wp oa post` can be answered by normalizing `oa` and querying the
tree: the handful of candidate rules that come back are fed to the dispatch
tactic which tries `rw` / `simp only` in the `TacticM` layer.

We deliberately do *not* pre-compile a `Sym.Simp.Theorem` bundle here: that
bundle is only needed by a future `SymM`-based rewrite loop (see the
deferred `mvcgen'` bridge notes in `docs/agents/program-logic.md`), and
eagerly computing one per registered rule both bloats oleans and drags
several `Sym.Simp.*` modules into the import closure of every downstream
tactic consumer. The dispatch tactic today works off the comp-keyed tree
alone. If a `SymM` migration later needs the theorem bundle, it can be
rebuilt on demand from `getAllWpStepEntries` via `Sym.Simp.mkTheoremFromDecl`.

## Entry layout

`WpStepEntry` mirrors the `Lean.Elab.Tactic.Do.SpecAttr.SpecTheorem` layout
where the shapes line up: `proof : SpecProof` captures the origin (global
decl / local hyp / raw proof) and supports a future `SpecTheorem` bridge,
`compPattern : Sym.Pattern` carries the comp-keyed pattern, and
`priority : Nat` mirrors core's default.

The dispatch tactic `runWpStepRules`, together with the canonical
registrations for every shipped `wp_*` lemma, lives in
`VCVio.ProgramLogic.Tactics.Common.WpStepDispatch`.

## Future-proofing note

`Lean.Meta.Sym.Pattern` and `Lean.Meta.Sym.Simp.DiscrTree` are under active
development upstream. If a toolchain bump breaks the registry, the affected
surface is confined to the selector in `buildWpStepEntry` and the lookup
path in `getRegisteredWpStepEntries`; downstream tactic dispatch works
through `WpStepEntry.declName?` and is insulated from `Sym` API churn. -/

Layout mirrors `Lean.Elab.Tactic.Do.SpecAttr.SpecTheorem` as much as the
VCVio-specific shape (equational `wp` rewrites rather than Hoare triples)
allows. We store only the comp-keyed `Sym.Pattern` and an origin marker;
the theorem's full LHS pattern is reconstructible on demand via
`Sym.Simp.mkTheoremFromDecl` for any future `SymM` rewrite path. -/
