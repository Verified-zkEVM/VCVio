# Probability Reasoning (EvalDist and ProbComp)

For the cross-project survey of SPMF, Mathlib measures and kernels, PolyFun
coalgebraic limits, ArkLib, Bluebell/Iris, and possible long-term migration paths, see
[`Probability Semantics for Computations: Landscape and Design Options`](../reading/probability-semantics-landscape.md).
The accepted design for new work is
[`Denotational Probability Semantics`](../reading/denotational-probability-semantics.md): use
Mathlib measures for closed denotations, kernels for environment/state-indexed computations,
effect-preserving outcome types for transformers, and keep `Pr[...]` as the discrete compatibility
surface. [`docs/reading/`](../reading/README.md) indexes the full design record.

The primary notation is now measure-valued: `𝒟[mx] : Measure α`. The former finite distribution
API is explicit as `evalSPMF mx` / `𝒮[mx]`. `Pr[...]` remains the discrete compatibility façade;
theorems `probOutput_eq_evalSPMF_toMeasure`, `probEvent_eq_evalSPMF_toMeasure`, and
`probFailure_eq_evalSPMF_toMeasure` state its meaning through the explicit compatibility measure.
Direct `FreeM` measure semantics has corresponding `FreeM.evalDist_apply_singleton` and
`FreeM.evalDist_apply_setOf` coherence lemmas. This split is intentional. An unconditional
`Eq.rec` law for `Pr[...]` only needs equality of result types in the discrete façade, whereas a
measure denotation also depends on the selected `MeasurableSpace`; type equality does not identify
those structures. We therefore do not install a blanket finite-type measurable-space instance.

`evalDist_eq_evalSPMF_toMeasure` is the sole deprecated whole-denotation bridge. It applies to the
canonical compatibility adapter; measure-native semantics should remain on `𝒟[…]` instead of
round-tripping through the finite backend.

## ProbComp and Sampling

`ProbComp α = OracleComp unifSpec α` — computations with only uniform sampling.

### Sampling notations

| Notation | Function | Type | Requirement |
|----------|----------|------|-------------|
| `$ᵗ T` | `uniformSample` | `ProbComp T` | `[SampleableType T]` |
| `$[0..n]` | `uniformFin n` | `ProbComp (Fin (n + 1))` | — |
| `$[n⋯m]` | `uniformRange n m` | `ProbComp (Fin (m + 1))` | `n < m` |
| `$ xs` | `uniformSelect` | `OptionT ProbComp β` | `[HasUniformSelect cont β]` |
| `$! xs` | `uniformSelect!` | `ProbComp β` | `[HasUniformSelect! cont β]` |

### SampleableType instances

Available for: `Bool`, `Fin n` (for `[NeZero n]`), `ZMod n`, `BitVec n`, `α × β` (from components), `Vector α n`, `Fin n → α`, `Matrix`.

### HasUniformSelect instances

- `$ xs` works for `List`, `Finset`, `Array` (can fail with `none` on empty)
- `$! xs` works for `Vector α (n+1)`, `List.Vector α (n+1)` (guaranteed non-empty)

## Decision Tree: Which Lemma Do I Reach For?

1. **Goal is `Pr[= y | mx >>= my] = ...`?**
   → Start with `probOutput_bind_eq_tsum`

2. **Goal is `Pr[p | mx >>= my] = ...`?**
   → Start with `probEvent_bind_eq_tsum`

3. **Need to swap two binds?**
   → Use `vcstep` if the swap should close the equality
   → Use `vcstep rw` / `vcstep rw under n` if you need an explicit rewrite step

4. **Need `Pr[= y | f <$> mx]`?**
   → If `f` is injective: `probOutput_map_injective`
   → Otherwise: `probOutput_map_eq_tsum_subtype` or `probOutput_map_eq_sum_finSupport_ite`

5. **Need to restrict a sum to support?**
   → `probOutput_bind_eq_tsum_subtype` or `probOutput_bind_eq_sum_finSupport`

6. **Continuation doesn't depend on result?**
   → `probOutput_bind_const` / `probEvent_bind_const`

7. **Two computations have same distribution?**
   → For legacy coupling lemmas, show `evalSPMF oa = evalSPMF ob`, or use
     `relTriple_eqRel_of_evalSPMF_eq`. For Mathlib probability results, compare `𝒟[oa]` and `𝒟[ob]`.

## `grind` vs `simp` on Probability Goals

`grind` and `simp` have complementary strengths here, and reaching for the wrong one is the most
common way to get a `grind` that hangs.

**Use `simp` to compute a concrete probability or factor structure.** `simp` evaluates
`Pr[= x | $ᵗ T]`, `Pr[p | $ᵗ T]`, products of uniform draws, etc.; `grind` is not an `ℝ≥0∞`/`Fintype.card`
arithmetic engine and will not finish these (it fails fast).

**Use `grind` for symbolic / membership / directed-iff goals.** Equiprobability
(`Pr[= x | $ᵗ T] = Pr[= y | $ᵗ T]`), `x ∈ support (…)`, `Pr[= x | mx] = 0 ↔ x ∉ support mx`, and
similar are squarely in `grind`'s wheelhouse.

**Why some characterization lemmas are `@[simp]` but not `@[grind]`.** A characterization whose RHS
introduces an *unbounded* quantifier or set over the support —
`Pr[…] = 0/1 ↔ ∃/∀ x ∈ support …`, `support = {x}`, `support = ∅` — is a `grind` **saturation
hazard**: as `grind` case-splits the iff it instantiates and Skolemizes the support quantifier into
fresh witnesses, which the always-tagged `bind`-expansion lemmas (`support_bind`,
`probFailure_bind_eq_add_tsum`, `mem_support_bind_iff`, …) re-expand into yet more `support`/`Pr[…]`
terms, with no finite grounding (`support ($ᵗ α) = Set.univ` is infinite). The hazard is
**combinatorial, not per-lemma**: no single one of these lemmas saturates `grind` on its own (restore
any one and a `grind` that should fail fast stays fast), but tagged *together* they form a re-trigger
cycle — restoring all of them makes that same `grind` run ~25× longer. The **hub of the cycle is the
`probEvent_eq_one_iff` family**: its RHS `Pr[⊥|mx]=0 ∧ ∀ x∈support, p x` couples the `probEvent`,
`probFailure`, and `support` layers at once (drop it and the blow-up roughly quarters). So that
family, together with the `∃`-Skolemizing `probEvent_ne_zero_iff` and the `probEvent_eq_zero_iff`
families, is kept `@[simp]`-only (fixed orientation, no case-split — safe). The *directed
single-variable* membership bridges (`probOutput_eq_zero_iff : … ↔ x ∉ support`, `probOutput_pos_iff`,
`mem_finSupport_iff`, `mem_finSupport_iff_mem_support`) are confluent and stay `@[grind =]`.

Lemmas kept `@[simp]`-only by this rule (in `EvalDist/Defs/Basic.lean` unless noted):
`probEvent_eq_zero_iff(')`, `probEvent_ne_zero_iff(')`, `probEvent_eq_one_iff(')`,
`one_eq_probEvent_iff(')`, `probOutput_eq_one_iff`, `one_eq_probOutput_iff`, `probFailure_eq_one_iff`;
and `mem_support_bind_iff` / `mem_finSupport_bind_iff` (untagged — `support_bind` / `finSupport_bind`
are the `simp` forms).

**Support-quantifier lemmas verified safe in isolation, kept `@[grind =]`.** A few carry the support
quantifier yet sit *outside* the `probEvent_eq_one_iff` hub cycle and add no measurable `grind` cost
on their own, so they keep their `grind` tag: `probEvent_pos_iff(')`, `probOutput_eq_one_iff'` (the
mirror of the never-dropped `one_eq_probOutput_iff'` — both are the `finSupport`-singleton form), and
`probFailure_bind_eq_zero_iff` (in `EvalDist/Monad/Basic.lean`). These are safe **only while the hub
family stays `@[simp]`-only**: re-tagging the `probEvent_eq_one_iff` family alongside them re-forms the
saturation cycle. `VCVioTest/LongChainPrograms.lean` is the 10+-step stress benchmark for exactly
this.

**If a `grind` proof needs one of these, re-supply it locally:** `grind [probEvent_eq_zero_iff]`. This
keeps the bridge out of the default set (so naive `grind` on a probability goal fails fast instead of
hanging) while letting the proof that genuinely needs it opt in.

**`Set.Nonempty`-phrased companions stay in the default `grind` set.** `grind` keeps `Set.Nonempty`
atomic (it does not unfold it to `∃ x ∈ support`), so a characterization phrased via `Nonempty`
carries the same information without the saturating quantifier. `probFailure_eq_one_iff_not_nonempty`
(`Pr[⊥ | mx] = 1 ↔ ¬ (support mx).Nonempty`) is the `grind`-friendly companion to the `simp`-only
`probFailure_eq_one_iff` (`… ↔ support mx = ∅`); reach for the `Nonempty` form when a `grind` proof
needs to reason about a computation failing (or not) with probability one.
`support_uniformSample_nonempty` (`(support ($ᵗ α)).Nonempty`, `@[grind]`) closes the loop, letting
`grind` conclude e.g. `Pr[⊥ | $ᵗ α] ≠ 1` end-to-end.

The event-probability versions follow the same recipe with the *filtered* support `{x ∈ support mx | p x}`
(the reachable outputs satisfying `p`): `probEvent_eq_zero_iff_not_nonempty`
(`Pr[ p | mx] = 0 ↔ ¬ {x ∈ support mx | p x}.Nonempty`) is the `@[grind =]` companion to the
`simp`-only `probEvent_eq_zero_iff`. Its sibling `probEvent_ne_zero_iff_nonempty` (`Pr[ p | mx] ≠ 0 ↔ …`)
exists but is deliberately **untagged**: the trio of `Nonempty` companions tagged together re-forms
a saturation cycle in the *generic-monad* context (`grind` on the `probEvent_eq_one_iff` statement
shape times out instead of failing fast; dropping any one of the three restores fail-fast), and
dropping the `≠ 0` sibling is free — `grind` recovers `≠ 0 ↔ Nonempty` from the kept
`= 0 ↔ ¬ Nonempty` form by classical negation. The `Pr[…] = 1` companions are deliberately
*omitted* entirely: a `Nonempty`-phrased `probEvent_eq_one` keeps its `Pr[⊥ | mx] = 0` conjunct,
which re-couples it to the hub family; the `= 1` cases use `grind [probEvent_eq_one_iff]` opt-in
instead. `VCVioTest/GrindFailFast.lean` gates all of this: each dropped lemma has a
`fail_if_success grind` + `grind [<lemma>]` example over a generic `m`, so both a bad re-tag
(bare `grind` starts succeeding) and a new saturation (the timeout escapes `fail_if_success`)
fail the build loudly.

**Monad/functor laws normalise structure for `grind`.** `bind_pure`, `bind_assoc`, and
`map_pure` are tagged `@[grind =]` (in `EvalDist/Monad/Basic.lean`); `pure_bind` is already in the
default set from core (`attribute [grind <=] pure_bind` in `Init.Control.Lawful`), so it is not
re-tagged here. They are confluent rewrites, so
`grind` collapses a computation's structure (`mx >>= pure = mx`, `pure a >>= f = f a`, …) *before*
falling into `probOutput`/`tsum` expansion — turning what would otherwise be a `grind` *explosion* on
a `bind`/`pure`-shaped probability/support/distribution equality into a quick solve
(`Pr[= x | mx >>= pure] = Pr[= x | mx]`, `𝒮[do let x ← mx; pure x] = 𝒮[mx]`,
`support (do let b ← $ᵗ Bool; pure b) = Set.univ` all close by bare `grind`). `bind_pure_comp` /
`map_eq_bind` are omitted (function argument under a binder, unindexable). A *non-trivial*
`<$>` / `if` / `<*>` does not normalise to a `pure`, so those structured equalities stay
`simp`-terminal.

**Independent products factor via `@[grind norm]`, not E-matching.** The second factor of
`Pr[= z | (·, ·) <$> mx <*> my]` sits under a binder (`Seq.seq`'s `Unit → _` thunk), which
`grind`'s pattern compiler cannot index — tagging the factorization lemma `@[grind =]` yields an
"invalid pattern" error (so do `pure_seq`/`seq_pure`). The escape is `grind`'s *normalization*
phase: `probOutput_seq_map_prod_mk_eq_mul` is `@[simp high, grind norm]`, so bare `grind` factors
the applicative spelling (and closes e.g. equiprobability of a uniform product). The `bind`-spelled
product (`do let x ← mx; let y ← my; pure (x, y)`) remains `simp`-only — the second draw sits under
`bind`'s continuation, which the seq-keyed norm rule does not reach.

**`grind norm` can starve E-matching — use it sparingly.** Norm rules rewrite goal/hypothesis
terms *before* E-matching, so a norm rule whose result no longer matches the `@[grind =]` patterns
disconnects them. Concretely: `@[grind norm] bind_pure_comp` (`mx >>= fun a => pure (f a)` →
`f <$> mx`) closes a couple of `target(grind)` gaps but breaks the `replicate` gates — the goal's
do-block normalises to a `<$>` form while the E-matching-side `replicate` unfolds stay in `bind`
form, and the E-graph never connects the two. It is therefore deliberately **not** tagged. Gate any
new `@[grind norm]` candidate against all of `VCVioTest/{ProbabilityTactics,MonadProbability,`
`LongChainPrograms,GrindFailFast}.lean` before keeping it.

**Structural additions to the default set** (all gated in `VCVioTest/GrindFailFast.lean`):
`OracleComp.replicate` unfolds (`replicate_zero`, `replicate_succ_bind`, `replicate_pure`,
`replicateTR_*` — the proof-level loop combinator; core already grind-tags the `List.mapM` /
`foldlM` / `forIn` layer), `Functor.map_map`, `probEvent_False`/`probEvent_false`, and the
`simulateQ` routing layer (`QueryImpl.add_apply_inl/inr`, `simulateQ_add_liftComp_left/right`,
the `withBadFlag`/`withBadUpdate`/`flattenStateT` run-shapes, `simulateQ_option_elim(M)`). The
`simulateQ_add_liftComp` pair also *fixes a saturation*: bare `grind` used to time out on a routed
`simulateQ (impl₁ + impl₂)` goal over a lifted computation.

`VCVioTest/ProbabilityTactics.lean` is the living benchmark and **gate** for all of this: a broad
corpus of probability / event / failure / support / distribution facts organised by category, each
closed by a single *terminal* tactic. Where a fact closes by **both** `simp` and `grind`, both are
kept (the mirror), so each tactic stays exercised on that shape; where only one closes, the gap is a
`target(simp)` / `target(grind)` note. A regression in either tactic surfaces there in isolation.
When adding probability automation, add the corresponding battery rows.

`VCVioTest/MonadProbability.lean` is the **generic-`m`** companion: the same gate over an abstract
monad `m` with the EvalDist instance stack (`[LawfulMonadLiftT m SPMF]`, …) and over the concrete
transformers (`OptionT`, `ExceptT`, `SPMF`, `Id`), where the lemmas are actually stated. It surfaces
facts `ProbComp` masks — chiefly the **failure factor**: over a monad that can fail,
`Pr[= y | mx *> my] = (1 - Pr[⊥ | mx]) * Pr[= y | my]` and `Pr[⊥ | mx <* my]` /
`Pr[⊥ | mf <*> mx]` are inclusion–exclusion (`Pr[⊥|a] + Pr[⊥|b] - Pr[⊥|a]*Pr[⊥|b]`); both collapse
to the `ProbComp` forms only because `Pr[⊥] = 0` there. New API filled along the way:
`probOutput_map` (the `probOutput`/`<$>` companion to `probEvent_map`, `@[grind =]`), `support_guard`,
and the `orElse` (`<|>`) probability lemmas for `OptionT (OracleComp spec)` (`probFailure_orElse` etc.).

**Opting out downstream.** VCVio deliberately extends the *default* `grind` set — the monad laws
above plus the probability/support bridges — and these tags are inherited by every project that
imports it. All of the standard escape hatches work if a downstream `grind` call misbehaves:
disable a rule per call (`grind [-bind_pure]`), ignore the default set entirely
(`grind only [the, lemmas, you, want]`), or unset a tag for a whole file
(`attribute [-grind] bind_pure`). `grind?` reports a minimal `grind only [...]` call for a goal it
closes, which is the easiest way to make a fragile call site independent of the default set.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Missing probability spec classes**: on `OracleComp spec`, `evalSPMF`/`probOutput`/`Pr[...]` require `[IsProbabilitySpec spec]`. Uniform/cardinality lemmas and support-probability lemmas require `[IsUniformSpec spec]`, not just `[spec.Fintype] [spec.Inhabited]`. Use `IsUniformSpec.ofFintypeInhabited spec` when a concrete finite inhabited spec should use uniform sampling. `𝒟[...]` additionally needs an ambient `MeasurableSpace` on the output.

2. **Carrying duplicate probability instances**: do not add a separate `[IsProbabilitySpec spec]` when `[IsUniformSpec spec]` is already in scope. `IsUniformSpec` extends `IsProbabilitySpec`; a second instance can make instance search ambiguous and may not describe the same distributions.

3. **Using `support` when `finSupport` is needed**: `probOutput_bind_eq_sum_finSupport` requires `[DecidableEq α]` and `[HasEvalFinset m]`.

4. **Forgetting `probOutput_eq_zero_of_not_mem_support`**: useful when restricting sums.

5. **`evalSPMF` on bare `query t`**: works directly when the expected type pins `query t` to a monadic form, since `query` resolves to `HasQuery.query`. Write `evalSPMF (query t : OracleComp spec _)` (or hand the result to a context that provides the same ascription). If you need the primitive `OracleQuery spec _` (e.g. for `OracleQuery.cont`), use `spec.query t` instead.
