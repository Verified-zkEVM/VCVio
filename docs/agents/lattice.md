# LatticeCrypto Layout and Workflows

## What Lives Where

The lattice stack is split into four layers:

- `LatticeCrypto/`: generic lattice algebra, hardness assumptions, scheme specs, security theorems, and executable concrete implementations.
- `LatticeCryptoTest/`: ACVP vectors, randomized regression tests, and differential checks against native reference code.
- `csrc/`: small C shims that expose the native ML-DSA, ML-KEM, and Falcon implementations to Lean.
- `third_party/`: vendored native backends used by the FFI and test harnesses.

Use `VCVio/` when you are changing framework abstractions such as `SignatureAlg`, `IdenSchemeWithAbort`, `GPVHashAndSign`, or `FujisakiOkamoto`. Use `LatticeCrypto/` when you are instantiating those abstractions for a lattice scheme.

## Core Entry Points

- `LatticeCrypto/MLKEM/Arithmetic.lean`: ML-KEM arithmetic assembly and vector types.
- `LatticeCrypto/MLKEM/Primitives.lean`: abstract sampling, hashing, and encoding-facing operations.
- `LatticeCrypto/MLKEM/KPKE.lean`: public-key encryption layer.

### Falcon

- `LatticeCrypto/Falcon/Params.lean`: scheme constants.
- `LatticeCrypto/Falcon/Arithmetic.lean`: Falcon arithmetic assembly and integer-polynomial infrastructure.
- `LatticeCrypto/Falcon/Primitives.lean`: abstract primitive operations such as sampling, hashing, and compression.
- `LatticeCrypto/Falcon/Scheme.lean`: scheme semantics and the GPV bridge.
- `LatticeCrypto/Falcon/Security.lean`: high-level security statements.
- `LatticeCrypto/Falcon/SISBridge.lean`: PSF collisions to NTRU-SIS kernel vectors, and the EUF-CMA bounds restated against the keyed NTRU-SIS problem.
- `LatticeCrypto/Falcon/Concrete/`: executable FFT, NTT, floating-point emulation, keygen, sampling, signing, and FFI support.
- `LatticeCrypto/Falcon/Concrete/NonVacuity.lean`: a degree-one instance witnessing that the security theorems' hypotheses are jointly satisfiable.

## How It Connects To `VCVio`

The lattice schemes are not standalone frameworks. They reuse the generic cryptographic interfaces in `VCVio/CryptoFoundations`:

- ML-DSA instantiates `IdenSchemeWithAbort` and `FiatShamirWithAbort`.
- Falcon instantiates `GPVHashAndSign` and `GenerableRelation`.
- ML-KEM uses the generic `AsymmEncAlg`, `KEMScheme`, and Fujisaki-Okamoto security surfaces.

If a change affects both the generic abstraction and a lattice instantiation, update both sides in one pass. Do not leave compatibility shims behind.

## Picking the Right File

When the task is about:

- proof-level semantics or reduction statements: start in `Scheme.lean` or `Security.lean`
- FIPS algorithm structure: start in `Signature.lean`, `KEM.lean`, or `Internal.lean`
- executable arithmetic or codec behavior: start in `Concrete/`
- native differential tests or vector failures: start in `LatticeCryptoTest/` and then follow the import chain into `Concrete/` or `csrc/`
- generic security-game surfaces: start in `VCVio/CryptoFoundations/`

## Common Gotchas

- Keep the proof-level and executable layers distinct. `Scheme.lean` is usually the semantic model; `Concrete/` files are the executable realization.
- ML-DSA has both an identification-scheme layer and a FIPS signing layer. Changes to challenge formation, abort conditions, or rounding often need updates in both `Scheme.lean` and `Signature.lean`.
- ML-KEM separates K-PKE, deterministic internal algorithms, and the top-level checked KEM wrapper. Put changes at the lowest layer that matches the semantics you need.
- Falcon uses GPV-style abstractions at the proof layer and FFT / FPR machinery at the executable layer. Do not mix those concerns unless you are explicitly proving the bridge.
- Differential tests rely on `csrc/` and `third_party/`. If a pure Lean change breaks only those tests, check for serialization, endian, or fixed-size input mismatches before touching the mathematical layer.
