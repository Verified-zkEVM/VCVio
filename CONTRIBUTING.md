# Contributing to VCVio

Thanks for contributing.

Start with:

- [`README.md`](README.md) for the project overview
- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for repo workflow, module layering, and proof guidance
- the relevant guides under [`docs/agents/`](docs/agents/)

Before sending work for review:

- Run `lake exe cache get && lake build`.
- After adding new `.lean` files, run `./scripts/update-lib.sh`.
- Avoid leaving `sorry` in finished work unless the change is explicitly meant to preserve partial work.
- State security reductions for a named reduction, simulator, or extractor, not for one that merely
  exists. Adversary types carry no resource bound and Lean can choose witnesses classically, so
  `∃ B, bound ≤ advantage B` holds for every scheme. See
  [Name the reduction in the theorem statement](docs/agents/crypto.md#name-the-reduction-in-the-theorem-statement).
- Keep repo-wide Lean options in `lakefile.lean`. Do not restate `autoImplicit = false` with per-file `set_option` lines.
- Do not disable linters locally or globally to make warnings disappear. Fix the underlying issue instead of adding `set_option linter.* false`, `set_option weak.linter.* false`, or repo-level linter suppressions.

## Pull Request Checks And Merge Queue

Before enqueuing a reviewed PR, inspect every check on its current head, including lint and
downstream builds beyond the required-check subset. Resolve failed and cancelled runs; a
successful duplicate does not clear a cancelled run. Use `gh run rerun RUN_ID` for a cancelled
workflow and `gh run rerun RUN_ID --failed` after diagnosing retryable failures. Wait for the
reruns to finish before enqueuing.

VCVio's `main` uses the merge queue. GitHub-marked stacked PRs require the
[asynchronous merge API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pulls/pulls#merge-a-pull-request-asynchronously):
`PUT /repos/Verified-zkEVM/VCVio/pulls/NUMBER/merge-async` with `sha` set to the reviewed head
and `merge_action` set to `merge_queue`. Omit custom merge-method and commit-message parameters;
the queue controls them. The ordinary CLI auto-merge path and GraphQL enqueue operation reject
these stacked PRs. Check the returned request UUID and queue entry, then wait for the queue's
checks and actual merge result before reporting a merge.

## Attribution And File Headers

This repo uses explicit Lean file headers. Every new Lean file should start with the standard header:

```lean
/-
Copyright (c) CURRENT_YEAR Author Name. All rights reserved.
Released under Apache 2.0 license as described in the file LICENSE.
Authors: Author Name
-/
```

Replace `CURRENT_YEAR` with the calendar year when the file is created.

Use the following attribution policy:

1. **New files**: Add the standard header with the current year and the author name(s) that should be credited for the new file.
2. **Routine edits to existing files**: Preserve the existing header. Do not rewrite attribution just because you touched the file.
3. **Substantial rewrites or replacements**: If a file is effectively replaced with new content, or an old file is renamed/recreated as a genuinely new file, update the header to reflect the new authorship.
4. **Copied or ported material**: If a new file is derived from an existing file or external source and substantial original structure/content remains, preserve any required upstream attribution and add current credited authors as appropriate.
5. **AI assistance**: Do not add a separate AI-attribution line. Use the repo's normal header format and list only the credited author name(s).

When in doubt, prefer:

- preserving attribution on incremental edits
- updating attribution only when the file is genuinely new or materially replaced

## Documentation Expectations

- Every ordinary Lean source file should have a module docstring near the top using `/-! ... -/`.
- Import-only umbrella modules such as `VCVio.lean`, `LatticeCrypto.lean`, and `Examples.lean`, along with `lakefile.lean`, should stay bare.
- Public definitions and major theorems should have declaration docstrings using `/-- ... -/`.
- Module docstrings should give a concise title and summary, and include notation or references when that context materially helps a reader.
- Declaration docstrings should describe what a definition is or what a theorem states, not how it evolved.
- Docstrings must be intrinsic and descriptive. Cross-reference live definitions when helpful, but do not mention removed or renamed declarations, change history, or reactive phrases such as "replaces" or "renamed from".
- If a file cites papers, include a references section in the module docstring or cite the source clearly in the surrounding docs.
- For ordinary Lean source files, use this prologue layout:
  1. copyright / license / authors header
  2. one blank line
  3. `module`
  4. public and private imports
  5. one blank line
  6. module docstring
  Keep exactly one blank line between these blocks.

## Module Scopes

All active Lean libraries and tests use the module system. Put ordinary declarations in a
`public section` and tactic/elaborator declarations in a `public meta section`. Existing source
files generally use `@[expose] public section` to preserve pre-migration definitional equality;
new files use plain `public section` and expose individual definitions with `@[expose]` when
unfolding is part of their intended public API. CI limits broad exposure per library; see the
[module-system guide](docs/agents/module-system.md#validation-and-coordinated-rollout) for the
exposure check and baseline workflow.
Executable and runtime implementation modules should use opaque `public section` when callers do
not need to unfold their definitions.

Use `public import` for a dependency that downstream importers should receive transitively,
`public meta import` for exported compile-time dependencies, and plain `import` for a private
implementation dependency. `import all` is appropriate in a proof module that deliberately needs
an imported module's private implementation. Do not use the transitional
`backward.privateInPublic` or `backward.proofsInPublic` options.

Cross-package `import all PolyFun.…` is forbidden: add a public PolyFun law or API instead. See
[`docs/agents/module-system.md`](docs/agents/module-system.md) for the visibility decision tree and
the long-term VCVio/PolyFun boundary.

`LatticeCryptoTest.lean` is intentionally curated rather than generated because its executable
modules define colliding root-level `main` declarations. For the same reason, `HashSigTest` has no
generated root umbrella; build its named executables and modules directly.

### Section Headers Within A File

Use Mathlib-style doc-comment section headers, **not** ASCII banners.

For an inline section break inside a Lean file, use a one-line docstring header that doc-gen will render in the generated documentation:

```lean
/-! ## Section title -/
```

Or, for a section with its own paragraph of explanation:

```lean
/-!
## Section title

Optional paragraph describing what the section contains.
-/
```

Do **not** use ASCII banners such as:

```lean
-- ============================================================================
-- § Section title
-- ============================================================================
```

ASCII banners are visually loud, do not appear in the generated documentation, and make the file feel partitioned in a way that the type system does not enforce. Prefer the `/-!` form, which both reads as natural prose and surfaces in `doc-gen4` output. If a section is large enough to warrant its own banner, it is usually large enough to warrant its own `namespace` or its own file.

## Toolchain And Dependency Bumps

The toolchain and Mathlib move together, and the other pins follow them. The order that keeps
`lake update` idempotent (see the comment above the PolyFun `require` in `lakefile.lean`):

1. `lean-toolchain`, then the Mathlib tag in `lakefile.lean`.
2. The `cslib` and `PolyFun` revisions, each to a commit built against that Mathlib. Program
   logic uses the pinned Lean core WP interface through PolyFun.
3. `lake update --keep-toolchain`, then `lake exe cache get`.
4. `./scripts/validate.sh --lint --test --axioms`; fix what the new toolchain flags rather than
   silencing it (`docs/agents/gotchas.md` §23), and update `scripts/axiom_baseline.json` only for
   an intentional change in `sorry` debt.
5. Re-verify the upstream-alignment ledger (`docs/reading/upstream-alignment.md`): every row is
   checked against the newly pinned trees, never diffed against the previous ledger.
6. Update the version mentions in `AGENTS.md` (*Building*) and `docs/agents/gotchas.md` §26.

## Style Notes

- Keep imports at the top of the file.
- Follow Mathlib naming conventions where possible. See the [Mathlib naming guide](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html) for the full set of rules. The capitalization rules in particular:
  - Terms of `Prop`s (e.g. proofs, theorem names) use `snake_case`.
  - `Prop`s and `Type`s (or `Sort`) (inductive types, structures, classes) are in `UpperCamelCase`.
  - Functions are named the same way as their return values (e.g. a function of type `A → B → C` is named as though it is a term of type `C`).
  - All other terms of `Type`s (basically anything else) are in `lowerCamelCase`.
- Respect the module layering documented in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).
- Use `/-! ## Title -/` doc-headers, not ASCII banners, for inline section breaks (see *Documentation Expectations* above).

For probability tactic tests, follow the
[tactic-test conventions](docs/agents/probability.md#normal-forms-and-the-tactic-contract).

### Section Variables

Lean includes an instance-implicit section variable in every theorem whose statement mentions
the variables its type refers to, whether or not the proof uses it, and the `unusedSectionVars`
linter then demands an `omit [...] in` line. Definitions are unaffected: their unused variables are
pruned after elaboration. So a `variable` line carries an instance assumption only when the
theorems in its scope genuinely share it. An assumption a few declarations need goes on those
declarations; an assumption a contiguous block of declarations shares gets a `section` around that
block with its own `variable` line, reordering declarations when that keeps the file readable. An
assumption derivable from another in scope (`[Finite X]` beside `[SampleableType X]`, `[Fintype X]`
beside `[FinEnum X]`, `[Nonempty X]` beside `[Inhabited X]`) is not declared at all; the proof
derives it (`Fintype.ofFinite`, `SampleableType.finite`). `omit` is for the genuine exception in a
section, not for choreography: a file with more `omit` lines than `variable` binders needs its
sections rethought. Beyond the noise, omitted variables still take part in instance search while
a statement elaborates, and hypothesis changes to a definition ripple into the omit lists of every
file that mentions its types; see gotcha 31 in [`docs/agents/gotchas.md`](docs/agents/gotchas.md).
