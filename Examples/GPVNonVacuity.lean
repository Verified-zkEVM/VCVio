# GPV #188 EUF-CMA: hypothesis-consistency witness

The GPV hash-and-sign EUF-CMA bounds (`GPVHashAndSign.forgery_yields_collision_or_exact_match`
and the `euf_cma_*` corollaries) are stated under side conditions — PSF correctness and regularity,
a never-failing trapdoor sampler, the random-oracle "forger queries its forgery point" convention
(`ForgesQueriedPoint`), and a query-count bound (`signHashQueryBound`).  A conditional theorem says
nothing if its hypotheses are jointly uninhabitable: this file rules that out with a concrete
instance for which every side condition holds simultaneously.  This is a **logical consistency
(inhabitance) witness only** — the one-point key space and two-point domain carry no
quantitative security content.

The witness is the canonical bijective PSF over `Bool` with `PK = SK = Unit`: `eval` is the
identity, `trapdoorSample` returns its argument (the inverse of the identity), and the shortness
predicate is constantly `true`.  The adversary `adv` queries the random oracle once at a fixed point
and then forges at that same point, so its forgery key is constant and always cached — witnessing
`ForgesQueriedPoint`.

* `bijPSF_correct` / `bijPSF_regularity` — the PSF-side conditions.
* `bijPSF_neverFail` — the trapdoor sampler never fails.
* `bijPSF_hForge` — the forger queries its forgery point, for *every* domain sampler.
* `adv_signHashQueryBound` — the adversary makes `0` signing and `1` random-oracle queries.
* `gpv188_hyps_inhabited` — all five side conditions hold for the single instance
  `(bijPSF, hr, adv)`, in exactly the shape the headline bounds consume them.

standard GPV side conditions hold simultaneously: the forger queries its forgery point for every
domain sampler (`ForgesQueriedPoint`), the adversary makes `0` signing and `1` random-oracle queries
(`signHashQueryBound`), the PSF is correct (`Correct`), the trapdoor sampler never fails
(`NeverFail`), and the PSF is regular (`Regularity`).  Each conjunct is stated in the exact shape
the headline bounds `GPVHashAndSign.euf_cma_split_bound` and
`GPVHashAndSign.euf_cma_collision_bound` consume — in particular `ForgesQueriedPoint` universally
quantified over the domain sampler — so their hypothesis conjunction is inhabitable.  This witness
carries no quantitative security content. -/
