# Interop

Experimental bridges that let VCVio reason about Lean code emitted by Rust
verification frontends (currently [hax](https://github.com/cryspen/hax) and
[aeneas](https://github.com/AeneasVerif/aeneas)).

> **Lean 4.31 baseline:** Interop is dormant. Neither backend is resolved by
> Lake, and CI intentionally excludes the `Interop` aggregate target. Hax does
> not yet support Lean 4.31; Aeneas does, but its VCVio bridge has not been
> revalidated. Source and TCB-isolation checks remain in place.

## TCB Isolation Contract

The single most important property of this library is that **nothing in core
VCVio depends on it**. Pulling hax / aeneas into the build adds a sizeable
trusted computing base (extraction frontend, Charon, the backend's own
runtime axioms), and we never want a routine `lake build` of the core
framework to inherit that.

The contract is enforced at three levels:

1. **Lake**: `Interop` is its own `lean_lib` in `lakefile.lean`, sibling to
   `LatticeCrypto`/`Examples`. Cross-library imports are physical: a file
   under `VCVio/`, `LatticeCrypto/`, `LatticeCryptoTest/`, `Examples/`,
   `ToMathlib/`, `FFI/`, `VCVioWidgets/`, or `VCVioTest/` must never
   `import Interop.…`, `import Hax.…`, or `import Aeneas.…`.
2. **CI**: `scripts/check-interop-isolation.sh` greps for forbidden imports
   and exits non-zero on violation. `.github/workflows/interop-isolation.yml`
   runs it on every PR and on pushes to `main`.
3. **Reverse direction**: `Interop/**` is allowed to depend on `VCVio/**`,
   `ToMathlib/**`, hax (`Hax.…`), and aeneas (`Aeneas.…`), but **not** on
   `LatticeCrypto/**`, `Examples/**`, `LatticeCryptoTest/**`, `FFI/**`,
   `VCVioWidgets/**`, or `VCVioTest/**`.
   Those are themselves clients of VCVio. The same script checks this.

If you need to share infrastructure between Interop and another library,
move the shared piece into `VCVio/` first.

```

`Rust/Common.lean` is **self-contained**: it builds without hax or aeneas
loaded, by mirroring their shared `Error` enum and reconstructing the
`ExceptT Error (OptionT (OracleComp spec))` stack that hax's `RustM` collapses
into. The actual `MonadLift` instances from hax/aeneas live in `Hax/` and
`Aeneas/`, where they can use the upstream definitions.

## Git-pinned Backend Requires

`lakefile.lean` carries explicit git pins for both backends. Current state:

```lean
-- Hax: disabled; upstream does not build with Lean 4.31.
-- require Hax from git
--   "https://github.com/cryspen/hax" @ "492a34e3" / "hax-lib/proof-libs/lean"

-- Aeneas: disabled, but pinned to a published Lean 4.31 nightly.
-- require aeneas from git
--   "https://github.com/AeneasVerif/aeneas" @
--   "15b968482b0dcd7aae45020b6d1bca39b5024af5" / "backends/lean"
```

### Require order matters

`require Hax` must appear **before** `require "leanprover-community" /
"mathlib"`. Hax transitively pins `Qq` at `v4.29.0-rc1`, Mathlib pins it
at the final release; Lake's conflict resolver takes the **last**
`require` of each dependency, so mathlib goes last to win. Wrong order
produces `mathlib: failed to fetch cache` on `lake update`.

We git-pin by default so reproducible builds are guaranteed. Bumping a
pin is a deliberate one-line change reviewed alongside any TCB delta.
