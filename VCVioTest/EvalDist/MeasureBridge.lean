# The measure gate

The measure-side counterpart of `VCVioTest/ProbabilityTactics.lean`: goal families about the
primary measure `𝒟[…]`, each closed by one terminal tactic, following the conventions of
`CONTRIBUTING.md` (*Tactic Gate Files*). The contract it pins is that on a discrete carrier the
measure side reduces *into* the discrete façade: singleton, event and total masses become
`Pr[…]`, and an integral against `𝒟[mx]` becomes `expectedValue mx g`, after which the façade's
own `simp`/`grind` contract applies. The Giry laws for `bind`/`map` stay out of default `simp`
on both sides, and the integral form of a bind is an intermediate, not a target.

The same entries run with the compatibility adapter (no measure specification in scope), with
the free-monad fold (a local `IsProbabilitySpec.toMeasureSpec`), and over `OptionT ProbComp`,
where failure mass is visible; all three satisfy `DiscreteEvalDistCompatible`. The total-mass
entries use `Fin 3` rather than `Bool` because Mathlib's `simp` rewrites `(Set.univ : Set Bool)`
to the literal `{false, true}` before any `𝒟`-keyed lemma can see it.
