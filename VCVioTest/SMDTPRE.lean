# End-to-end canaries for SM-DT-PRE

The pins in `HardnessAssumptions/TweakableHash/SMDTPRE.lean` stop at the challenge oracle's `run`;
these run the whole game, winning condition included. Between them they exercise the three parts of
`SM_DT_PRE_Experiment` no oracle pin reaches: that an accepted query's sampled message is recorded
where the winning condition looks for it, that the index lookup resolves against the challenge
history, and that a rejected query leaves nothing to invert.

The challenge oracle draws its own message, so the subspace is a one-element type whose
`SampleableType` instance is written out rather than inferred. That makes the draw reduce, and the
transcripts below are then equations between `pure`s rather than statements about `support`.

Because the target cap is one, append order is unobservable here; `MultiTargetCollection.lean`
carries the order canaries for the SM-TCR side, whose challenge history is built by the same
`TweakFresh` discipline.
