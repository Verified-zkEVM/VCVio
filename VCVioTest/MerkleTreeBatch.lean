# Inductive Merkle Batch-Opening Canaries

Concrete examples that pin the public behavior of path-pruned batch openings: hash argument
order, pruning shape, the singleton reduction to an ordinary authentication path, the
all-selected and empty-selector boundaries, and cross-selector collision extraction.
