# The `H_msg` ITSR bridge

`H_msg(R, PK.seed, PK.root, M)` names, through `hmsgIndices`, one FORS leaf in each of the `k`
trees of one bottom-layer FORS instance.  This module connects that index list to the FORS
coordinates the rest of the lane speaks in, and connects an ITSR target transcript to a list of
signing queries at one key pair.

Everything here is deterministic.  No probability, adversary, advantage or game hop appears, and
no `ProbComp` is run.  The ITSR *winning condition* does appear, because it is a decidable
predicate on a list and a pair; what does not appear is the experiment that samples the keys.

## The one contested correspondence

`HashSig.SLHDSA.Security.CanonicalGames` keys `hmsgKeyedHash` on the randomizer and takes as its
hashed input the whole record `⟨PK.seed, PK.root, M⟩`.  The EasyCrypt development's `MCO` clone
instantiates the same abstract keyed-hash theory at `in_t <- msg`: the message **alone**.  The two
games are therefore not the same game, and this module is where the difference is stated, proved
and delimited.  `hmsgNarrowItsrProblem` transcribes the source's shape — keyed on the randomizer,
over the message alone, at a public seed and root fixed once and for all — so that the difference
can be written as a relation between two Lean objects rather than as a remark.

**What is equivalent.**  `wins_embedTargets_iff` is an `Iff`.  Along the embedding
`M ↦ ⟨PK.seed, PK.root, M⟩` at one fixed key pair, a wide win *is* a narrow win and a narrow win
*is* a wide win.  Neither direction is lossy: the embedding is injective, so freshness transports
both ways (`mem_embedTargets_iff`), and the two hashed values are equal by definition, so the
selected indices agree on the nose (`targetIndexSet_embedTargets`).  A reduction all of whose
`H_msg` inputs carry one key pair therefore gains nothing and loses nothing from the widening.

**What is strictly stronger.**  The wide game is not confined to one key pair, and the extra room
is real, not bookkeeping.  `notMem_embedTargets_of_ne` says a candidate whose seed or root differs
from the embedding's is fresh *for free*, against any transcript, without the adversary doing
anything; and `wins_of_hmsg_agree` turns that free freshness into a win as soon as the digest at
the two key pairs agrees.  In particular, for an `H_msg` that ignores its `PK.seed` and `PK.root`
arguments the wide game falls to one target query — query `⟨s', r', M⟩`, receive the key `R`, and
return `(R, ⟨s, r, M⟩)`.  Its narrow game is not weakened by the blinding at all: at *every* fixed
key pair that game is the unblinded bundle's narrow game at the one pair the blinding fixes, so
narrow hardness is carried across exactly, and the narrow game never sees a second key pair to move
to.  So wide-hardness implies narrow-hardness at every fixed key pair, and the converse fails: as an
assumption, the FIPS-shaped one is strictly the stronger.

Those last two paragraphs speak of adversaries and hardness, and nothing here proves them at that
level: they are the informal reading of the deterministic `Iff` below together with the obvious
query embedding, and the statements that carry a probability, an adversary and an advantage are
slice 8's.  What this module proves is the deterministic core they rest on.

**What would be lost if a reduction needed the converse.**  A reduction that wanted to discharge a
Lean SLH-DSA bound from the source's assumption alone — that is, to conclude wide-hardness from
narrow-hardness — cannot, and no amount of care in stating the bridge would let it.  What such a
reduction must do instead is stay inside one fibre, and that is a property of how it forms its
inputs, not of any lemma here.  `embedTargets` and the candidate side of `wins_embedTargets_iff`
share one `(pkSeed, pkRoot)` argument pair for exactly that reason: a reduction that let the two
drift apart cannot instantiate that lemma at all, rather than instantiating it at a statement a
reviewer has to notice is the wrong one.  The drifted terms themselves type-check perfectly well —
`notMem_embedTargets_of_ne` and `wins_of_hmsg_agree` are *about* such terms — so what the shared
pair buys is a unification constraint on one lemma, not a type-level guarantee about reductions.

**Direction of the assumption, stated once.**  Assuming the FIPS `H_msg` interleaved-target-subset
resilient is assuming more than the source assumes of `mco`.  A formalisation may assume more; it
may not claim the source's assumption suffices.  Nothing in this module claims that.

**FIPS states no such property.**  The final (August 2024) FIPS 205 gives `H_msg` the signature
`𝔹ⁿ × 𝔹ⁿ × 𝔹ⁿ × 𝔹* → 𝔹ᵐ` in §4.1 and calls it with all four arguments at Algorithm 19 line 5
(signing) and Algorithm 20 line 8 (verification), and says nothing anywhere about interleaved
target subset resilience: the words *interleaved*, *resilience* and *ITSR* do not occur in the
document.  §10.2 goes the other way and says that collisions on the functions instantiating
`H_msg`, `PRF`, `PRF_msg`, `F`, `H` and `T_l` are believed to have no adverse effect on SLH-DSA's
security — qualified in its own footnote, which excepts applications needing message-bound
signatures.  The ITSR assumption is therefore imported from the SPHINCS+ analysis, not read off the
standard, and this module's correspondence claims are against the EasyCrypt development.

## Correspondence with the EasyCrypt development

The message-compression function is `op mco : mkey -> msg -> msgFORSTW * index`
(`FORS_ES.ec:412`), and the index map is `op g` (`:421-424`), which produces one triple per FORS
tree: the flat instance index, the tree number, and the leaf that tree's chunk of the compressed
message selects.  `MCO` clones the abstract keyed-hash theory at `key_t <- mkey`, `in_t <- msg`,
`out_t <- msgFORSTW * index`, `f <- mco` (`:426-433`) — the `in_t <- msg` line (`:428`) is the
deviation this module is about — and `MCO_ITSR` clones its ITSR sub-theory at `g <- g` and
`dkey <- dmkey` (`:435-441`).

That second `MCO_ITSR` substitution is the one place the Lean object does not follow the clone.
`dmkey` is declared `op [lossless] dmkey : mkey distr` (`:310`); losslessness is the only
assumption on it, `SPHINCS_PLUS.ec` re-declares it the same way (`:323`) and passes it through
(`:501`, `:533`), and nothing in the development ever makes it uniform.  What the source does set
is an identification and not a distribution: the ITSR clone takes `dkey <- dmkey` (`:438`) and the
`MKG.PRF` clone that idealises `PRF_msg` takes `doutm x <- dmkey` (`SPHINCS_PLUS.ec:422`) — the
same `dmkey` on both sides, so the ITSR key and that idealised `PRF_msg`'s output are one
distribution at *every* admissible `dmkey`, not at a distinguished one.  That identification is the
reading the `KeyedHash.ITSR` module's own docstring gives the sampled key, and it carries over
whichever distribution is chosen.

Choosing one is this development's own step, and the choice is forced rather than argued.
`KeyedHashFamily.keygen` is a `ProbComp` field, not a theory parameter carrying a losslessness
proof obligation: omit it and Lean reports `Fields missing: keygen`, so the Lean object has to name
a computation exactly where the clone can defer.  The only key distribution in scope is the ambient
instance's — drop `[SampleableType prims.Y]` from `hmsgNarrowItsrProblem` and the single error is
`failed to synthesize instance of type class SampleableType prims.Y`, at `$ᵗ prims.Y`; the
`Primitives` bundle carries no distribution of any kind, its `PRFmsg` being a function rather than
a sampler, so there is nothing weaker to inherit.  And `SampleableType`'s defining law is
`Pr[= x | selectElem] = Pr[= y | selectElem]`, which *is* uniformity.  `hmsgItsrProblem` made the
same forced choice already, and the two have to agree.  So `hmsgNarrowItsrProblem` fixes the key
distribution to `$ᵗ prims.Y`, and the narrow problem is the source's shape *up to the key
distribution*, which it strengthens from an arbitrary lossless one to the uniform one.

The strengthening costs nothing for what is proved here, and that is derivable rather than
asserted: `ITSRProblem.Wins` is built from `indexSet` and `targetIndexSet`, both of which read
`khf.hash` and `indices` and neither of which reads `khf.keygen`.  Of the thirty-five statements
below exactly one — `hmsgNarrowItsrProblem_keygen` — mentions the key distribution, and replacing
that distribution by a different computation of the same type leaves every other statement, and
every check in `HashSigTest.SLHDSA.HmsgWitnesses`, unchanged.  Where the difference would cost
something is the game-level hop, which needs both experiments to sample the key the same way;
there the two Lean problems agree with *each other*, and what does not carry over is the source's
quantification over an arbitrary lossless `dkey`.

The winning condition is the ITSR game's own return, `KeyedHashFunctions.eca:1567`, with
`h k x = g (f k x)` at `:1476`.  That is the definition `KeyedHash.ITSRProblem.Wins` mirrors, in the
same two parts and with the same quantifier: every index the candidate selects occurs among the
indices the recorded targets select, and the candidate pair is not one of those targets.  Where the
FORS reduction discharges it is a different place, the `conseq` at `FORS_ES.ec:3897-3900` inside
`EUFCMA_MFORSTWESNPRF_OPRE`; citing only that would understate, because the shape is the game's and
not the reduction's.

`valid_ITSR` itself is set at `FORS_ES.ec:3212-3214`, from `lidxs' <- g (mco mk' m')` and
`! (mk', m') \in zip …mks …qs` — pair freshness against the recorded transcript, which is what
`embedTargets` and `notMem_embedTargets_of_notMem` transport.  The uncovered index is selected at
`:3223` by `find (fun i => ! i \in …lidxs) lidxs'`, first match, which is why `findUncoveredIndex`
is `List.find?`; the selected tree and leaf are then read at the flat leaf address `dftidx * t +
dflfidx` (`:3229-3230`), which is `globalLeaf`, and FIPS 205 Algorithm 16 line 4 and Algorithm 17
line 5 index the FORS trees the same way.

Two things about the reduction that bound this module's obligations.  `R_ITSR_EUFCMA`
(`FORS_ES.ec:2176`) forwards the forgery's message key and message unchanged (`:2237-2239`) and
neither verifies the forgery nor tests its freshness itself, so nothing here needs a validity
hypothesis on the ITSR side.  And the source proves no standalone lemma for the step
`coord_unrevealed_of_notMem` states; it is folded into the OpenPRE `conseq` and closed by SMT over
the concrete opened-index list.

## The index-to-coordinate maps

An `HmsgIndex` carries four fields: the two digest indices that name the FORS instance, the FORS
tree inside it, and the leaf inside that tree.  The lane's FORS statements are indexed instead by
an instance address and a *global* leaf number running continuously across the `k` trees.
`HmsgIndex.forsAdrs` and `HmsgIndex.globalLeaf` are those two coordinates, and
`HmsgIndex.ext_of_coords` says the pair determines the index, which is what makes "this coordinate
was opened by no query" a statement about *this* index rather than about some index sharing its
coordinate.

`HmsgIndex.forsAdrs` repeats the body of `DigestParts.forsAdrs` rather than calling it, because an
`HmsgIndex` carries no `md` and a `DigestParts` cannot be built from one without inventing that
field.  The repetition is not left to inspection: `forsAdrs_eq_of_indices` proves the two agree
whenever the two indices do, and `forsAdrs_of_mem` is that equation at a digest the index belongs
to.  `globalLeaf` is grounded the same way, against `forsSigLeafIndex`, which
`HashSig.SLHDSA.Security.ForsWitnesses` derives from FIPS 205 Algorithm 16 line 4 and Algorithm 17
line 5.

A shift of `globalLeaf` does not stay at two sites.  Shifting the definition together with
`globalLeaf_of_mem` and nothing else leaves seven errors; carrying the shift through until the
library elaborates clean moves nine declarations — the definition, `globalLeaf_eq`,
`globalLeaf_lt`, `globalLeaf_div_pow_a`, `globalLeaf_of_mem`, `HmsgIndex.ext_of_coords`,
`uncoveredTarget_globalLeaf`, `forsSign_reveals_of_mem_hmsgIndices` and
`coord_unrevealed_of_notMem` — and seven of the fixture's statement pins with them.  Those pins
close the shift at build time.  At run time it is closed by six checks in
`HashSigTest.SLHDSA.HmsgWitnesses`, each of which reads the shifted leaf against something that
does not move with it, and each of which was measured on its own with the other five removed:
`forsSigLeafIndex`, the separately reviewed definition with its own citation; a hand-written
`tree * 2 ^ a + leaf`; the divide-back to the FORS tree; the `k * 2 ^ a` bound; the secret value
honest signing reveals at the coordinate; and a hand-written list of the two global leaves the
forged digest is expected to select, read against the hand-written table of `Adrs` records.

The per-index read of that `Adrs` table is *not* one of the six.  The shifted global leaf stands on
both sides of its comparison, so with only that check present the fully carried-through shift
passes: it pins how `forsNodeAdrs` builds an address from a given global leaf, and says nothing
about which global leaf.  So does the `Nodup` sweep over the sixty-four indices, which a shift
permutes bijectively.  The sixth check is the one that does: its left side moves with the shift
and its right side does not.

## First, not last

`findUncoveredIndex` is `List.find?`, so it returns the *first* index of the candidate's own list
that no target covers.  `FORS_ES.ec` selects the FORS tree it attacks with `find`, which is also
first-match, so first is the source's choice and not an arbitrary one.  Soundness alone does not
distinguish first from last — `List.findLast?` would satisfy every soundness statement here
unchanged — so the choice is pinned by `findUncoveredIndex_eq_some_iff`, which additionally says
that every index *before* the returned one is covered.  That is the statement a `findLast?` variant
fails.

## What the uncovered index does and does not say

`coord_unrevealed_of_notMem` is deliberately stated at the level of a FORS *coordinate* — an
instance address together with a global leaf number — and not at the level of a secret *value*.
"The signer never revealed this value" is not derivable and is not true in general: two
`forsSkGenCore` calls at two different coordinates may collide, and nothing in the development
excludes it.  Neither is the game-level reading derivable here: turning a coordinate into a
position in an OpenPRE target list needs an index function from coordinates to list positions,
which no module on this branch supplies.  What is available, and what the OpenPRE winning condition
asks for, is that the coordinate itself was opened by no query, and that is what is proved.

The source proves no such lemma in isolation: the corresponding step is folded into the `conseq`
that discharges the OpenPRE postcondition and closed by SMT over the concrete opened-index list.
There is no named source lemma to point at, and this docstring does not invent one.

## Labels

*Deterministic inclusion* — a statement with no list of signing queries in it.  Reading the free
data binders off all thirty-two, they are exactly: a parameter set, validated or not; a primitive
bundle; seeds and node values; an address; a digest or the `DigestParts` it splits into; a semantic
index; a FORS tree number; a message; a candidate keyed-hash pair, or the `HmsgITSRInput` inside
one; and an ITSR target transcript over that widened input type, which the statement is handed or
builds for itself.  No natural number occurs free in any of them:

* `HmsgIndex.forsAdrs`, `forsAdrs_layer`, `forsAdrs_tree`, `forsAdrs_type`, `forsAdrs_keyPair`,
  `forsAdrs_eq_of_indices`, `forsAdrs_of_mem`, `forsAdrs_eq_bottom`;
* `HmsgIndex.globalLeaf`, `globalLeaf_eq`, `globalLeaf_lt`, `globalLeaf_div_pow_a`,
  `globalLeaf_of_mem`, `HmsgIndex.ext_of_coords`;
* `hmsgNarrowItsrProblem`, `hmsgNarrowItsrProblem_hash`, `hmsgNarrowItsrProblem_keygen`,
  `hmsgNarrowItsrProblem_indices`, `indexSet_embedTargets_entry`;
* `wins_of_hmsg_agree`;
* `findUncoveredIndex`, `findUncoveredIndex_eq_find?`, `findUncoveredIndex_eq_some_iff`,
  `mem_indexSet_of_findUncoveredIndex`, `notMem_targetIndexSet_of_findUncoveredIndex`,
  `wins_of_findUncoveredIndex_eq_none`, `itsr_wins_or_uncovered`, `uncoveredTarget`,
  `uncoveredTarget_eq`, `uncoveredTarget_globalLeaf`;
* `forsSign_getElem_sk`, `forsSign_reveals_of_mem_hmsgIndices`.

*Transcript transport* — a statement carrying a free list of signing queries, and so about the
transcript that list embeds to:

* `embedTargets`, `embedTargets_eq`, `mem_embedTargets_iff`, `notMem_embedTargets_of_notMem`,
  `notMem_embedTargets_of_ne`, `targetIndexSet_embedTargets`,
  `mem_targetIndexSet_embedTargets_iff`, `wins_embedTargets_iff`;
* `coord_unrevealed_of_notMem`.

Those forty-one are the module's whole interface; none is `private` and none carries `@[expose]`.

/-! ## The source's shape, and the widening

`hmsgNarrowItsrProblem` is the EasyCrypt `MCO_ITSR` clone transcribed: `key_t` the randomizer,
`in_t` the message alone, `out_t` the digest, `g` the FIPS digest-to-FORS-leaf map.  It exists so
that the difference between the two games can be *proved* rather than described. -/

/-- The ITSR problem of the EasyCrypt `MCO` clone, at one public seed and root fixed outside the
game: keyed on the message randomizer, hashing the message alone.

The `pkSeed` and `pkRoot` arguments are parameters of the *problem*, not of the hashed input.  That
is the source's shape on the hashed input, where the message-compression function takes a key and
a message and no public key material at all, and the clone sets its input type to the message type.
It is not the source's shape on the key distribution: the correspondence section above records the
one place the two part, and why it costs nothing here. -/

/-- **The widened game admits wins the source's game has no room for.**  Whenever one randomizer
gives the same digest at two distinct `H_msg` inputs, the single-target transcript at the second is
already a win at the first.

Instantiated at two inputs carrying the same message and different key material, this is a
one-query break of the widened game for any `H_msg` that ignores its `PK.seed` and `PK.root`
arguments — a bundle whose narrow problem at every fixed key pair is whatever it was, since the
narrow game has no second key pair to move to.  So narrow hardness does not imply wide hardness,
and the widened assumption is strictly the stronger of the two.
