# The deterministic strong-unforgeability residual

`VCVio.CryptoFoundations.SignatureAlg` splits strong unforgeability into ordinary existential
unforgeability plus one extra event: a valid signature, not itself returned by the signing oracle,
on a message that *was* sent to it.  That split is a probability identity, and it is generic.  This
module is the SLH-DSA-specific deterministic remainder: what a signing log, a message and a
signature that the log does not contain as a pair yield about the `H_msg` input the signature names.

Everything here is deterministic.  No probability, adversary, advantage, game hop or `ProbComp`
appears, and no experiment is run.  Two library predicates on a log do appear —
`SignatureAlg.signingLogContains` and `QueryLog.wasQueried` — because both are decidable functions
of a list; what does not appear is anything that samples the key pair or bounds a probability.

## What the split leaves for SLH-DSA to do, and where it actually sits

The scheme dispatch of `HashSig.SLHDSA.Security.SchemeWitnesses` reads no log: `findWitness_isSome`
takes `[DecidableEq prims.Y]`, the byte laws, a secret seed, a public seed, a message, a signature
and a target, and the single hypothesis that the signature verifies.  So a forged signature routes
into a witness family whether or not its message was queried, and the strong-unforgeability split
buys the dispatch nothing.

What does read a log is the `H_msg` bridge of `HashSig.SLHDSA.Security.HmsgWitnesses`.  Its
dichotomy `itsr_wins_or_uncovered` needs the forged *pair* to be absent from the target transcript,
and the transcript a reduction records is this log's `(randomizer, message)` projection,
`logQueries`.  Under existential unforgeability that hypothesis is free: an unqueried message
contributes no entry at all, which is `notMem_embedTargets_of_not_wasQueried`.  Under strong
unforgeability it is not free, and supplying it is the whole SLH-DSA-specific residual.

`itsrFresh_or_sameRandomizer` is that residual.  It takes only the strong-unforgeability freshness
condition itself — the log does not contain this exact `(message, signature)` pair — and returns one
of two things: either the forged randomizer occurs in no logged signature at that message, and then
the pair is fresh at the embedded transcript and the bridge applies unchanged; or some logged
signature at that message carries the *same* randomizer, differs from the forged one, produces the
same `H_msg` digest split against the same public key, and differs from it in its FORS half or in
its hypertree half.

Note where the case split is taken.  It is not the queried/unqueried split of the library identity:
the dichotomy holds under pair freshness alone, and the unqueried case is the special case in which
the second branch is empty.  What the library's split does say about the second branch is that it
lives entirely inside the same-message event — a logged signature at `msg` makes `msg` queried,
which is `wasQueried_eq_true_of_mem_loggedSignatures`.

## What the second branch is worth, stated as theorems rather than as a caveat

On the second branch the `H_msg` bridge is not merely unproved, it is unavailable.  The forged pair
*is* one of the embedded targets (`mem_embedTargets_of_mem_loggedRandomizers`), so the winning
condition fails on its freshness conjunct (`not_wins_of_mem_loggedRandomizers`); and the candidate's
own selected indices are all covered by that same target, so the first-uncovered-index extractor
returns nothing (`findUncoveredIndex_eq_none_of_mem_loggedRandomizers`).  Both alternatives of
`itsr_wins_or_uncovered` are therefore closed off, and no amount of care in a reduction reopens
them.

What a reduction would have to use on that branch is the *pair*: two distinct signatures that split
to one digest, hence one FORS instance and one set of opened leaves, and differ somewhere in their
component vectors.  Three of the four merged families cannot be handed that pair at all, because
they compute their second object from `sk` rather than taking it: `findXmssWitness` recovers the
honest leaf and the honest WOTS+ signature from `sk` and the honest message, `findForsWitness` the
honest FORS material, and `findHypertreeWitness` carries `sk` down the layer walk.  For those, what
already applies to the forged signature alone applies here unchanged and the second signature enters
nowhere.

The WOTS+ family is not of that shape, and it is the one that has to be argued.  `findWotsWitness`
and its per-chain helper `findWotsChainWitness` are the lane's only two searches that take two
`(signature, message)` pairs; the partner is an arbitrary signature, and neither
`findWotsWitness_sound` nor `findWotsWitness_isSome` mentions `sk`.  The chain helper is inert when
the two messages agree — it returns nothing at an index unless the two chain-step counts differ
there — so what decides its reach is whether this branch drives the two messages apart.  Those two
messages are the FORS public keys the two signatures recover, which `verifyInternal` hands to the
hypertree as its layer-0 WOTS+ message; by `schemeParts_eq_of_randomizer_eq` the pair splits to one
digest against one public key, which leaves each of the two keys a function of that signature's FORS
half and of nothing that differs between them.

The branch does not drive them apart.  What it gives is a disjunction, and where only its hypertree
disjunct holds the two FORS halves are equal and the two recovered keys are one key; two FORS halves
that do differ may still recover one key, and the fixture's `forgeryFors` is a pair that does.  So
`findWotsWitness_isSome`'s guard `msg ≠ msg'` is met on the branch's pairs whose recovered keys
differ, and the search returns a witness on those; where the two keys coincide the guard fails and
that theorem says nothing either way.

What places the family out of scope is therefore not the guard but what a returned witness says.
`findWotsWitness_sound` concludes `WotsWitness.Valid … sig' msg'` — validity against the *supplied*
partner — and, as its own docstring records, says nothing about whether that partner was committed
as a game target.  Here the supplied partner is a second adversarial signature, so the witness is a
collision between two adversarial objects rather than an attack on honest committed material, which
is exactly the two-adversarial-signatures argument this lane holds out of scope.  A same-digest
extractor is therefore a further witness module with its own witness type, and there is none.

`HashSig.SLHDSA.Security.HypertreeWitnesses` holds a two-adversarial-signatures argument out of
scope for the existential-unforgeability line; `schemeParts_eq_of_randomizer_eq` and
`components_ne_of_ne_of_randomizer_eq` do not reopen it — they say what such an argument would be
handed, and prove no extraction from it.

## There is no strong unforgeability in the EasyCrypt development

This module's source correspondence is that it has none, and the reason is a difference in how the
two developments randomize signing rather than an omission.

Nothing in `FV-SPHINCSPLUS-EC` states a strong-unforgeability property.  Over the eleven `.ec` and
`.eca` files, the case-insensitive tokens `strong` and `unforge` occur zero times, and every
occurrence matching `suf` is the word `suff`.  Every freshness decision in the development is on the
message alone: the twenty assignments to `is_fresh` are `! m' \in qs` (`FORS_ES.ec:3370`, `:3588`,
`SPHINCS_PLUS.ec:1207`, `:1356`), a call to a `fresh` procedure (`FORS_ES.ec:2034`, `:3203`,
`SPHINCS_PLUS.ec:2126`, `:2149`, `:2175`, `:2235`), or a message disequality in the
no-adaptivity games (`FL_SL_XMSS_MT_ES.ec:1879`, `:3225`, `:3453`, `SPHINCS_PLUS.ec:2638`,
`WOTS_TW_ES.ec:2371`, `:2618`, `:3671`, `:3724`, `:3775`, `:3915`); and all three declarations of
a `fresh` procedure take a `msg` (`FORS_ES.ec:1988` in an oracle module type, `:2099-2101`,
`SPHINCS_PLUS.ec:2039-2041`), the two with bodies returning `! m \in qs`.  No signature is compared
anywhere.

Two consequences, and they are different from each other.

**The source needs no randomizer reasoning.**  Its ITSR pair-freshness conjunct
`! (mk', m') \in zip …mks …qs` (`FORS_ES.ec:3214`) is discharged by the surrounding game's own
freshness: that game returns `is_valid /\ is_fresh` with `is_fresh` the message test
(`FORS_ES.ec:3203`, `:3244`), so no winning run has the forged message among the queried ones and no
recorded pair can carry it.  This holds however the message key is produced, and is the step Lean's
strong-unforgeability freshness condition cannot take.

**The source's transcript carries one randomizer per message.**  The message key is
`op mkg : mseed -> msg -> mkey` (`FORS_ES.ec:409`, `SPHINCS_PLUS.ec:409`), a function of the master
seed and the message with no per-signature argument, and the signing oracle before the `MKG` hop
computes `mk <- mkg ms m` (`SPHINCS_PLUS.ec:2020`).  After the hop the oracle memoizes on the
message — `if (m \notin mmap) { mk <$ dmkey; mmap.[m] <- mk } mk <- oget mmap.[m]`
(`SPHINCS_PLUS.ec:2082-2086`, and `FORS_ES.ec:2070-2074` for the M-FORS oracle) — and the hop's
equivalence identifies that map with the generic `PRF` oracle's own memo table,
`O_CMA_SPHINCSPLUSTWFS_NPRF.mmap{1} = O_PRF_Default.m{2}` (`SPHINCS_PLUS.ec:3112`), whose ideal
branch is memoized the same way (`KeyedHashFunctions.eca:1630-1638`).  Signing is deterministic on
both sides of the hop, so re-signing a message returns the identical signature, and the list this
module calls `loggedRandomizers` would be constant at each message.

FIPS 205 Algorithm 19 sets `opt_rand ← addrnd` and then `R ← PRF_msg(SK.prf, opt_rand, M)` (lines 2
and 3), and §9.2 makes that hedged variant the default while offering `opt_rand ← PK.seed` as a
deterministic alternative under which "signing the same message twice will result in the same
signature".  `HashSig.SLHDSA.GeneralScheme.signInternalM` takes `addrnd` as an argument, and
`HashSig.SLHDSA.RandomOracle.slhSignM` samples it and passes it to the depth-one compatibility
signer `HashSig.SLHDSA.slhSignInternalM`, which derives `R` by the same
`core.PRFmsg sk.skPrf addrnd msg`.  So the Lean transcript is the hedged one and
`loggedRandomizers` at one message can hold as many distinct values as there were queries.  The
residual's second branch is what that costs.  The deterministic variant narrows the branch without
emptying it: the log at a twice-signed message then lists one randomizer once per query rather than
one per query, so a second signature there reuses it and lands in the branch just the same.  What
the variant removes is the width, not the case.

So the correspondence is: no source counterpart, because the source's game never reaches the case,
and its signer could not have populated it as widely if it had.

## What is deliberately not here

No probability, and in particular no use of `strongUnforgeableAdv.advantage_eq_euf_add_sameMessage`,
whose statement carries a runtime-factoring hypothesis and whose two summands are advantages.
Bounding the same-message summand for a specific reduction adversary is not done here, and it must
go through that identity rather than the unbounded `SameMessageBinding` wrapper: no `ε < 1` holds of
`SameMessageBinding` for a hash-based scheme, so a quantitative result has to take the per-adversary
form.  The generic Boolean partition inside that identity's proof is not restated here either: it is
not SLH-DSA-specific and the library already discharges it.

No extraction from the second branch, for the reason given above.  No `SignatureAlg` packaging: the
statements below are over `QueryLog (List Byte →ₒ GeneralScheme.SignatureCore vp prims.core)`, which
needs none, and every `SignatureAlg` in `HashSig` is at `p.d = 1`.  No equation relating a logged
signature to `signInternal`: nothing here needs one — the divergence above is exercised at values in
`HashSigTest.SLHDSA.SufResidual` instead.

## Labels

The lane's two labels, applied by the criterion the sibling modules use.

*Transcript transport* — a statement carrying a free signing log, and so about the transcript that
log projects to.  Twenty-three of the twenty-five declarations below are of this kind, which is what
one should expect of a module whose whole subject is what a log does and does not contain:

* `loggedSignatures`, `loggedSignatures_eq`, `mem_loggedSignatures`,
  `signingLogContains_eq_true_iff`, `wasQueried_eq_true_iff`,
  `wasQueried_eq_true_of_mem_loggedSignatures`, `sameMessage_condition_iff`,
  `exists_ne_of_sameMessage`, `loggedSignatures_eq_nil_of_not_wasQueried`;
* `loggedRandomizers`, `loggedRandomizers_eq`, `mem_loggedRandomizers`;
* `logQueries`, `logQueries_eq`, `mem_logQueries_iff`, `notMem_logQueries_of_not_wasQueried`;
* `notMem_embedTargets_of_not_wasQueried`, `notMem_embedTargets_of_notMem_loggedRandomizers`,
  `mem_embedTargets_of_mem_loggedRandomizers`, `not_wins_of_mem_loggedRandomizers`,
  `findUncoveredIndex_eq_none_of_mem_loggedRandomizers`,
  `wins_or_uncovered_of_notMem_loggedRandomizers`;
* `itsrFresh_or_sameRandomizer`.

*Deterministic inclusion* — a statement with no signing log in it.  There are two, and both are
about a pair of signatures rather than about a transcript:

* `schemeParts_eq_of_randomizer_eq`, `components_ne_of_ne_of_randomizer_eq`.

Those twenty-five are the module's whole interface; none is `private` and none carries `@[expose]`.

Nine of them carry `[DecidableEq (GeneralScheme.SignatureCore vp prims.core)]`.  That instance is
not derivable here: neither `SLHDSA.SignatureCore` nor `ForsTreeSigCore` nor `XmssSigCore` declares
or derives one, and `HashSig` contains no instance for any of the three.  It is required by the
library predicates being bridged, `SignatureAlg.signingLogContains` and `QueryLog.wasQueried`, and
it is carried as a hypothesis rather than supplied, because the instance belongs to the modules that
declare those signature types.

/-- The signatures a signing log returned for one message, in query order.

A `QueryLog` entry is a dependent pair of a queried message and the signature returned for it; this
selects the second components of the entries at `msg`.  Repeated queries on one message contribute
one entry each, so this list is as long as the number of times `msg` was signed, and two of its
entries may be equal.

/-- **Membership is exact-entry membership**, in both directions: a signature is listed at `msg`
exactly when the log contains the entry pairing `msg` with it.

The `Iff` is what makes the reading faithful rather than merely sound.  A one-way implication would
also hold of a definition that kept only the first entry at each message, and such a definition
would call a forged randomizer fresh when a later signature at the same message carried it.

their public seed and published root off it.  That is the discipline

/-- On the second branch the winning condition fails, and it fails on freshness.

Its other conjunct, coverage, is untouched — the candidate's indices are in fact all covered, by the
target the candidate itself is — so this is not a statement that the pair is far from winning; it is
a statement that the one thing the `H_msg` game asks for beyond coverage is exactly what a repeated
randomizer destroys.

on this branch: there is no win to report and no uncovered FORS leaf to hand the lane's extractor.

/-! ## What two signatures with one randomizer share, and where they differ -/

/-- Two signatures with equal randomizers produce one digest split against one public key on one
message, hence one FORS instance address and one FORS message.

The public key is whatever the verifier was handed and the message is the forged one; neither is
constrained, and no signature is required to verify.

/-- Two distinct signatures with equal randomizers differ in their FORS half or in their hypertree
half.

The disjunction is not exclusive and this says nothing about which half differs; the fixture
exhibits a pair for each.  It is stated submitted-first, as the lane's `tlCollision` and `fPreimage`
distinctness conjuncts are.

/-! ## The residual -/

/-- **The deterministic strong-unforgeability residual.**  A message and a signature whose exact
pair the log does not contain either name an `H_msg` input the recorded transcript does not contain
— and then the bridge of `HashSig.SLHDSA.Security.HmsgWitnesses` applies to them unchanged — or come
with a signature the log returned for that same message which carries the same randomizer, differs
from this one, splits to the same digest against the same public key, and differs from it in its
FORS half or in its hypertree half.

The hypothesis is the strong-unforgeability experiment's own freshness condition and nothing else.
In particular the queried/unqueried split of the library's partition identity is not taken here: it
is not needed for the dichotomy, and its unqueried half is the case in which the second branch is
empty, by `notMem_logQueries_of_not_wasQueried`.  What that split does add is that the second branch
occurs only inside the same-message event, by `wasQueried_eq_true_of_mem_loggedSignatures`.

Nothing is claimed about the second branch beyond the four facts listed.  Whether it can be
extracted from at all is a question about a witness family this lane has not built, and
`not_wins_of_mem_loggedRandomizers` and `findUncoveredIndex_eq_none_of_mem_loggedRandomizers` say
that the family it has built cannot be pointed at it.
