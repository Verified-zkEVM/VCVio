# Hypertree witnesses

The layer walk: a hypertree signature that recovers the honest public root from a forged message
must, at one of its `d` layers, present an XMSS signature that recovers the honest XMSS root of
that layer's tree from a message differing from `honestLayerMsg` there.  That message is the one
`GeneralHypertree.signFromPosition` signs at that layer, which is `signFromPosition_getElem`; it is
a statement about the honest structural signing loop, not about any transcript this module sees.
That layer's signature is then one XMSS forgery at one named tree address, which
`HashSig.SLHDSA.Security.XmssWitnesses` translates into a witness against `H`, `T_len` or `F`.

## What is proved, and what is not

The walk is `recoverFromPosition_binding`, proved by two-step induction on the number of remaining
layers, and `pkFromSig_binding` is its instance at the digest-derived layer-zero position.  The
extractor `findHypertreeWitness` computes the layer and the witness together, and its soundness
lemma places the witness at the position the returned layer names.

What is *not* proved is any statement about the layer the walk selects beyond its bound: the
extractor stops at the first layer whose recovered root is the honest one, and that is visible in
its two shape equations, but no theorem here says the selected layer is minimal, and none is
needed — a witness at any such layer is a witness.  Nothing here constructs an adversary, states
an advantage, performs a game hop, or claims that any honest execution queried a value a witness
attacks; those are program-level obligations of the later slice.

The plan for this slice also lists an unoriented divergence lemma, over two arbitrary signature
vectors, with both messages existentially quantified.  It is deliberately absent.  Its second
message is bound by the existential, so it cannot be identified with the honest one afterwards,
and the binding form below is therefore not a corollary of it but a separate induction; and a
statement that names no honest partner cannot feed a witness predicate.  The binding form is the
exhaustiveness the source discharges inline.

## Labels

*Deterministic inclusion* — a statement whose only free objects are a validated parameter record
or a `prims` over one, seeds, positions and addresses, natural-number indices, messages, and
signature or witness data, together with the structural side conditions their statements or proofs
need: the `DigestParts` the layer-zero position is parsed from, which three of them take —
`advance_initial_eq_atLayer`, `recoverFromPosition_of_pkFromSig` and `pkFromSig_binding`; the
`DecidableEq prims.Y` instance the extractor and its four lemmas take; and the
`prims.core.ByteLaws` argument `findHypertreeWitness_isSome` alone takes, which is what reaches the
WOTS+ extractor's completeness lemma.  The honest secret seed is taken by fifteen of the
twenty-seven: the honest running message, its three equations and the honest-signer bridge, the
walk and its two companions, the validity predicate and its unfolding equation, and the extractor
and its four lemmas.  The other twelve do not take one, because none of them names an honest
object: the eight position-arithmetic declarations, the witness type and its bound lemma, and the
two ledger statements.  The `p.Valid` argument
its predecessors carry is absent throughout: a `ValidatedParams` supplies it.

The declarations are:

* the position arithmetic `LayerPosition.next_congr`, `LayerPosition.advance` with its four
  equations `advance_zero`, `advance_next`, `advance_layer_val` and `advance_succ` and the
  separation lemma `advance_ne`, and the bridge `advance_initial_eq_atLayer`;
* the honest running message `honestLayerMsg` with `honestLayerMsg_zero`, `honestLayerMsg_succ`
  and `honestLayerMsg_next`, and `signFromPosition_getElem`, which identifies it with what
  `GeneralHypertree.signFromPosition` signs;
* the walk `recoverFromPosition_binding`, its top-level hypothesis bridge
  `recoverFromPosition_of_pkFromSig`, and its top-level instance `pkFromSig_binding`;
* `HypertreeWitness`, the bound `HypertreeWitness.layer_lt` its `Fin layers` label carries,
  `HypertreeWitness.Valid` and its unfolding equation `HypertreeWitness.valid_iff`;
* `findHypertreeWitness`, its two shape equations `findHypertreeWitness_eq_of_root` and
  `findHypertreeWitness_eq_next_of_ne`, and its two lemmas `findHypertreeWitness_sound` and
  `findHypertreeWitness_isSome`.

*Transcript transport* — a statement about the slice-1 coordinates and ledgers of
`HashSig.SLHDSA.Security`:

* `layerTreeCoord_advance_ne` is about `LayerTreeCoord`, a slice-1 coordinate, which is what the
  label covers: it separates the tree coordinates two different layers of one walk carry.  It
  names no ledger and asserts no membership.  It is the stronger of the pair it forms with
  `advance_ne`: `advance_ne` follows from it by `congrArg LayerTreeCoord.ofPosition`, while the
  step back would need `ofPosition` injective, and `ofPosition` drops the leaf.  Both end at
  `advance_layer_val`, which is how each is proved here;
* `advance_xmssNodeAdrsKey_injective` is about the encoded tweaks of the `xmssH` ledger.

Four private `Vector` lemmas carry the head-and-tail bookkeeping the two inductions need, and they
are the only private declarations.  `getElem_zero_eq_head` and `getElem_succ_eq_tail` read a vector
index as a head or a tail index; `head_insertIdx_zero` and `tail_insertIdx_zero` read the head and
tail of the vector the honest signer builds.  The second pair restates
`HashSig.SLHDSA.GeneralHypertree`'s own two, which are private there and so not in scope here.

`LayerPosition.advance` and its equations are declared in the `SLHDSA.LayerPosition` namespace
rather than this module's own, because they are position arithmetic and dot notation on a
`LayerPosition` resolves there.  `HashSig.SLHDSA.Position` has no `advance` today and this is its
only consumer, so it lives here; promoting it to that module later would move the declarations
without renaming them.

## The walk

Fix a reachable position `pos`, a count `layers` of positions from `pos` through the final layer,
a forged message `msg`, an honest message `msg' ≠ msg`, and a vector of `layers` XMSS signatures.
Recovery threads each layer's recovered root into the next position, as the message signed there.
The honest walk from the same position threads the honest XMSS roots instead, and its layer-`j`
message is `honestLayerMsg`: the given honest message at `j = 0`, and the honest XMSS root of the
layer-`(j-1)` tree afterwards.  Above layer zero it is therefore a function of the honest key
material and the position alone, with no honest signature in it, because an honest XMSS signature
recovers its own tree's root whatever it signs.

That `honestLayerMsg` is what the honest signer signs is proved, not assumed:
`signFromPosition_getElem` says the layer-`j` component of
`GeneralHypertree.signFromPosition` from `pos` on `msg'` is
`xmssSign` of `honestLayerMsg … j` at that layer's address and leaf.  It is the same two-step
induction, and it is what a consumer needs to identify the honest partner of a witness with the
material an honest signing query would have revealed.

If the forged walk ends at the honest top root then at some layer `j` the two walks meet: the
forged walk's layer-`j` recovery already equals the honest layer-`j` root, while its layer-`j`
message still differs from the honest one.  The induction is on `layers`, generalising the
position and both messages.  At one remaining layer the position is final, its address is the top
tree's, and `j = 0`.  At two or more, either the head recovery is already the honest root — then
`j = 0` and the messages differ by hypothesis — or it is not, and the induction hypothesis applies
at the next position with the two recovered roots as the two new messages, giving `j + 1`.

`LayerPosition.advance` is what lets the conclusion name layer `j`'s position.  It iterates `next`
and carries the same dependent bound `next` does, so `pos.advance j` is a `LayerPosition` exactly
when `pos.layer.val + j < d`.  It recurses on the left, `pos.advance (j+1) = (pos.next).advance j`,
which is the step the induction takes; `advance_succ` is the other associativity, needed to reach
`LayerPosition.atLayer`, and `advance_initial_eq_atLayer` is that bridge.  `next` takes its bound
as a proof argument, so rewriting under it needs `next_congr` rather than `rw`.

## The layer bound

The bound every statement here carries is `j < layers` against `pos.layer.val + layers = d` —
equivalently `pos.layer.val + j < d`.  The walk's own statements carry it as a hypothesis on a
bare `ℕ`; a `HypertreeWitness` carries it in its type, its label being a `Fin layers`, and
`HypertreeWitness.layer_lt` is the one reading of it the rest of the module uses.  It is the bound
the source's recorded targets are guarded by: each of the three case flags is an existential over
`0 ≤ i < d`, and each reduction picks its `i` with a list `find` over that range.

All three reductions use the layer the same way while re-walking the trajectory: each rebuilds that
layer's chain, compression and tree addresses with `set_ltidx ad i tidx`, and each returns an index
into its own challenge oracle's query list rather than an address.  The WOTS and `pkco` reductions
return `bigi predT (fun i => nr_trees i) 0 cidx * l' + tidx * l' + kpidx`; the `trh` reduction
returns `bigi predT (fun i => nr_trees i) 0 cidx * (2 ^ h' - 1) + tidx * (2 ^ h' - 1) +
bigi predT (fun i => nr_nodes i) 1 hidx + bidx`, scaled by one tree's node count rather than its
leaf count and indexed by the collision's height and breadth rather than by a key-pair index.  What
the `trh` reduction alone does in addition is build the address it *extracts* at,
`set_typeidx (set_ltidx ad cidx tidx) trhtype`, from the selected layer and the tree index there.
Either way the layer is one of the coordinates separating one recorded target from another, and
`0 ≤ i < d` is its range.

Two things turn on it, and a third does not.

* It is what *forms* the position: `LayerPosition.layer` is a `Fin d`.  Slice 1's ledgers are
  enumerations of exactly those typed positions, so without the bound there is no position, no
  address, and nothing listed.  The tree word needs no bound of its own — `LayerPosition.tree` is
  a `Fin (2 ^ layerTreeHeight vp layer.val)` and `next` carries that forward — and neither does
  the leaf, which is a `Fin (2 ^ h')`.
* It is what separates one layer's targets from another's, in all four branches.  Each of the four
  ledgers a hypertree witness can land in — `xmssNodeAddresses vp` for `hCollision`,
  `wotsPkAddresses vp` for `tlCollision`, `optionalWotsAddresses vp` for `fPreimage` and
  `wotsStepAddresses vp` for `fCollision` — is one list enumerated over *every* layer, so no type
  code separates two layers inside any of them.  What separates them is that each ledger's
  injectivity lemma concludes equality of the coordinate that ledger is indexed by, and those
  coordinates disagree across layers.  `advance_ne` is the common step: distinct layers below `d`
  give distinct positions, because `(pos.advance j).layer.val = pos.layer.val + j`.  For the
  `hCollision` branch the ledger is indexed by a `LayerTreeCoord`, which forgets the leaf, so
  `advance_ne` does not reach it and the branch needs its own reading of `advance_layer_val`:
  `layerTreeCoord_advance_ne`, composed with `xmssNodeAdrsKey_injective` by
  `advance_xmssNodeAdrsKey_injective`.  Both are restated here.  For the three WOTS+ branches no
  restatement is needed, because each of their injectivity lemmas already concludes an equality
  the position can be projected out of: `wotsPkAdrsKey_injective` is injective in the
  `LayerPosition` itself, so it contradicts `advance_ne` directly;
  `wotsOptionalStepAdrsKey_injective` concludes an equality of `WotsChainCoord`s, whose first
  component is the position, so it takes one `congrArg Prod.fst` first; and
  `wotsStepAdrsKey_injective` is injective in a `WotsChainCoord × Fin (w - 1)`, so its conclusion
  is a pair equality and it takes `congrArg (·.1.1)`.  Each of the three is a projection and a
  contradiction at the caller, not a lemma this module has to state.
* It is *not* what keeps a witness inside its own role's ledger, and it is not a height bound.
  The heights an XMSS witness carries are `XmssWitness.Valid`'s, unchanged here.

## Address roles

Every address a hypertree witness names is the address the underlying XMSS witness names at the
position `pos.advance w.layer`, so the membership lemmas of the slices below apply unchanged:
`HashSig.SLHDSA.Security.XmssWitnesses`' `mem_xmssNodeAddresses_of_leaf` for the `H` branch and,
through that module's `wotsLeafAdrs_eq_wotsInstanceAdrs`,
`HashSig.SLHDSA.Security.ReachableTargets`' `mem_wotsPkAddresses` together with
`HashSig.SLHDSA.Security.WotsWitnesses`' `mem_wotsStepAddresses_of_lt` and
`wotsPreimageAdrs_mem_optionalWotsAddresses` for the three WOTS+ branches.  None of them is
restated here, and neither is any game-shape bridge: `HypertreeWitness.Valid` reduces to
`XmssWitness.Valid` at a named position, so `xmssWitness_valid_hCollision_eval` and the three
WOTS+ bridges apply unchanged.

`advance_xmssNodeAdrsKey_injective` consumes `EncodedTargetLedgerConditions` rather than assuming
a fresh injectivity hypothesis, so a concrete profile discharges it through
`approvedEncodedTargetLedgerConditions`; the SHA-2 zero fallback is never treated as unreachable.

/-- Two different counts of layers advanced from one position land on two different positions,

This is what a consumer holding two hypertree witnesses at two layers of one walk needs in three of
the four branches: each of slice 1's four witness ledgers is enumerated over every layer, and the
three WOTS+ ones' injectivity lemmas each conclude equality of a coordinate whose position
component this refutes.  It is what those three need and all they need.  The fourth is the `xmssH`
ledger, indexed by a `LayerTreeCoord`, which `LayerTreeCoord.ofPosition` builds as
`⟨pos.layer, pos.tree⟩`, dropping the leaf; `xmssNodeAdrsKey_injective` concludes an equality of
those, which has no position component to refute, and `layerTreeCoord_advance_ne` is what that
branch uses instead.  `Params.Valid.hp_pos` gives at least two leaves at every layer and tree, so
that map is not injective and this statement's conclusion does not transport forward along it.

`layerTreeCoord_advance_ne` is that branch's own reading of `advance_layer_val`, and it is the
stronger of the two: this one follows from it by `congrArg LayerTreeCoord.ofPosition`, because a
function applied to equal arguments gives equal results and no injectivity is needed in that
direction.  Neither is derived from the other here, because this one is *Deterministic inclusion*
position arithmetic and taking that derivation would rest it on a *Transcript transport* statement
about a slice-1 coordinate.  Each ends at `advance_layer_val` — this one by projecting the layer
word out of the position, the coordinate one by way of `toAdrs`. -/

afterwards.

It is a function of the honest key material and the position alone.  No honest signature appears
in it, because root recovery from an honest XMSS signature reaches that tree's root whatever
message the signature signs, so the honest walk's layer-`(j+1)` message does not depend on its
layer-`j` message. -/

Everything else here calls `honestLayerMsg` the honest partner of a witness.  This is the lemma
that earns the name: without it the identification is a gloss, and a consumer that wants to say a
witness attacks material an honest signing query would have revealed has nothing to rewrite with.
`recoverFromPosition_signFromPosition` is the companion statement about where the honest walk
*ends*; this one is about what it signs at each step, and slice 8's identification of the honest
WOTS+ partner at a leaf runs through it.

The subject is the pure structural loop, not `GeneralHypertree.sign`, which is that loop under
`simulateQ (PublicHash.impl prims)`.  The step between them is one rewrite with
`GeneralHypertree.sign_eq_signFromPosition`, at `recoverFinal = (d == 1)` and the digest-derived
layer-zero position; it is not composed here, because every statement in this module is about an
arbitrary starting position and that equation is only about the initial one.

The induction is the same two-step one, generalising the position, the message, the layer index
and `recoverFinal` — whose value the signer discards, so both branches agree. -/

/-! ## The layer walk -/

/-- **The layer walk.**  A vector of `layers` XMSS signatures whose recovery from `pos` on the
forged message `msg` reaches the honest top-layer root exhibits a layer `j < layers` at which its
own recovered root is already the honest XMSS root of that layer's tree, while the message it
recovers from differs from the honest running message there.

That layer's signature is therefore an XMSS forgery at `(pos.advance j).toAdrs` on the leaf
`(pos.advance j).leaf.val`, which is the pair of hypotheses `xmssPkFromSig_forgeryCases` and
`findXmssWitness_isSome` take.

The proof is a two-step induction on `layers`, generalising the position and both messages, the
shape `recoverFromPosition_signFromPosition` already uses.  At no remaining layers the position's
own layer bound contradicts the hypothesis, so nothing is claimed there.  At one, the position is
final and `j = 0`.  At two or more the head recovery either is the honest root at `pos`, giving
`j = 0` with the messages distinct by hypothesis, or is not, and the induction hypothesis at
`pos.next` — taking the two recovered roots as its two messages — gives `j + 1`.

This is the Lean counterpart of the exhaustiveness of the source's three case flags, which
`FL_SL_XMSS_MT_ES.ec` discharges inline rather than as a named lemma: a `conseq` to a false
post-condition followed by an induction on `d` closed by SMT.  The flags themselves are
existentials over the same layer range, and each reduction selects its layer with a list `find`
over it.

/-! ## The extracted witness

A hypertree witness is a layer together with an XMSS witness at that layer's position.  Every
honest object it attacks is computed by `HypertreeWitness.Valid` from the honest secret seed and
the position the layer names — the honest tree at `(pos.advance layer).toAdrs`, the honest WOTS+
key material at the leaf `(pos.advance layer).leaf.val` that layer's signature opens, and the
honest running message `honestLayerMsg` there, which `signFromPosition_getElem` identifies with
the message `GeneralHypertree.signFromPosition` signs at that layer.  None of the three is a
field. -/

/-- A witness against one component hash at one hypertree layer: the layer, and an `XmssWitness`
at the position that layer names.  The position itself is not carried, because the walk's starting
position and the layer already fix it; `HypertreeWitness.Valid` recomputes it.

The layer is a `Fin layers`, indexed by the walk length the witness was extracted from, rather than
a bare `ℕ` with the bound carried as a side condition.  The bound is the same one every statement
here needs, and putting it in the type fixes the label's *range*.  It does not fix the label's
meaning, and the difference is worth stating exactly.

What the type refuses is the `+ 1` shift: `findHypertreeWitness`'s base case runs at walk length
one, where the label's type is `Fin 1`, so a base label of `1` carries the obligation `1 < 1`,
which is refutable rather than merely unproved.  What it still admits is any relabelling that
agrees with the identity at walk length one.  The reflection `t ↦ layers - 1 - t` — counting the
layer from the top of the walk instead of from `pos` — is the natural one, and it elaborates:
leave the length-one base label `⟨0, ·⟩`, label the length-`n + 2` base case `⟨layers + 1, ·⟩`,
drop the `+ 1` from the recursive step, read `layers - 1 - w.layer.val` in
`HypertreeWitness.layer_lt`, `Valid` and `valid_iff`, and add two `omega`-derived rewrites to
`findHypertreeWitness_sound`'s `more` branch.  Under it `w.layer` no longer counts layers advanced
from `pos` — a divergence at the walk's first layer is labelled `layers - 1` — while `Valid` still
names the right position, because it decodes the label.  A consumer pairing the raw label with a
`Fin d` layer would address the wrong tree.

Nothing here refuses that.  Every statement here that mentions the label either writes it — the two
shape equations — or reads it through `layer_lt` and `Valid`, so the reflection renumbers them along
with the extractor and they re-prove by the same inductions.  What
would *not* renumber is a statement tying the label to the walk's own indexing of the signature
vector — that the reported layer is the one whose component recovers the honest root there — and
that is the first-match property this module does not prove.

`HashSigTest.SLHDSA.HypertreeWitnesses` refuses it twice over, and the first of the two is a build
error rather than a run-time one.  Its statement pins restate the two shape equations and `Valid`'s
body with the label read raw, so the reflection applied to this module alone fails to elaborate
*there*, at five sites in two `example`s, before anything runs.  Renumber those pins with it and the
executable is what fails: `checkLayer` compares the reported label with the literal layer the
fixture built the divergence at, and the `posOf`/`advance` and `honestMsgAt`/`honestLayerMsg`
agreement checks are what stop those tables being renumbered to match. -/

This is the *derived* form of the bound a consumer used to destructure out of `Valid`'s
existential.  The existential's own conjunct was `w.layer < layers`, which is now `w.layer.isLt`
and needs no lemma at all; `Valid` carries neither, so this is where the bound every `advance` site
here needs comes from. -/

position's leaf, and the honest running message there — all three computed from the layer, none
supplied.  There is no layer-bound conjunct: the label is a `Fin layers`, so the bound is in the
witness's type, and `HypertreeWitness.layer_lt` is what forms the position from it.  That bound is
still what places every address the witness names in a slice-1 ledger, and still what separates
this layer's targets from another layer's inside the one `xmssNodeAddresses` ledger; it is now
carried by the data rather than asserted about it.

/-- Compute a hypertree witness from a vector of `layers` XMSS signatures, the forged message
`msg` the walk from `pos` starts with, the honest message `msg'`, and the honest key material.

The search walks the layers in order, comparing each layer's recovered root with the honest XMSS
root of that layer's tree.  At the first layer where they agree it hands that layer's signature to
`findXmssWitness` and labels the result with the layer; where they disagree it recomputes the next
position and recurses, carrying the recovered root as the next forged message and the honest root
as the next honest message.  At the last layer, if its recovered root is not that layer's honest
root, it returns `none`.

Each layer's guard is recomputed here from `sk`, and so is the honest message handed to
`findXmssWitness` at every layer above the first; the first layer's honest message is the caller's
`msg'`, the walk's own honest starting message, which this search does not compute.

The guard is the root match at the layer, not at the top, so the search does not need the walk to
reach the honest top root.  It stops at the first layer whose own recovered root is that layer's
honest root, wherever that falls, and whatever it returns there is valid all the same —
`findHypertreeWitness_sound` takes no top-root hypothesis.  There are exactly two ways it returns
nothing: no layer's recovered root was that layer's honest root, and the search reached the last
layer and stopped; or one was, and `findXmssWitness` returned nothing there.  The zero-length case
in the definition is unreachable — the position's own layer bound refutes its walk-length
hypothesis — and the recursion never enters it, descending only to length one. -/

/-- **Extractor soundness.**  Whatever `findHypertreeWitness` returns satisfies
`HypertreeWitness.Valid` against the honest hypertree, at the layer it reports and against the
honest running message there.

What this pins about the reported layer is worth stating exactly, because two different things
pin it and only one of them is this lemma.

The *relative* placement is this lemma's.  The recursive step rewrites through
`LayerPosition.advance_next` and `honestLayerMsg_next`, so dropping the `+ 1` from the extractor's
recursive label breaks this proof at that rewrite.  A `+ 2` there does not even reach it: the
recursive label's own bound would be `w.layer.val + 2 < layers + 2`, and the recursive answer
supplies only `w.layer.val < layers + 1`.

The *absolute* placement is the witness type's.  `HypertreeWitness.layer` is a `Fin layers`, so its
range is fixed by the walk length the witness was extracted from rather than by the statements that
read it.  A bare `ℕ` label would instead admit a uniform renumbering — base label `⟨0, ·⟩` to
`⟨1, ·⟩`, `w.layer` read as `w.layer - 1` in `Valid`, the bound relaxed to
`0 < w.layer ∧ w.layer ≤ layers` — which is a reparametrisation rather than an unsoundness: it
leaves `Valid`'s content unchanged, so the statements this module ships are all renumbered with it
and re-prove by the same induction.  What refuses it here is that the extractor's base case runs at
walk length one, where the label's type is `Fin 1` and the shifted base label's obligation is
`1 < 1`.  That obligation is refutable rather than merely unproved, so the renumbering is not
writable at all and the failure is a build error rather than a run-time one.

`HashSigTest.SLHDSA.HypertreeWitnesses` checks the reported layer a second way, not through
`HypertreeWitness.Valid`: it compares the label with the one its fixture built the divergence at,
and evaluates the witness through a hand-written table of positions and honest messages, with an
agreement check pinning that table against `advance` and `honestLayerMsg` at fixed layers.  Those
checks are what caught the renumbering when the label was a bare `ℕ`, and they are kept.

There is no top-root hypothesis.  Each layer's guard is the root match at that layer, which is
`findXmssWitness_sound`'s own hypothesis, so the conclusion holds whether or not the walk reaches
the honest top root.  The leaf bound the XMSS lemma needs is free: it is `pos.leaf.isLt` at every
position the walk visits.  Nothing here says anything is returned; existence is
`findHypertreeWitness_isSome`'s, and that one does take the top root.

/-! ## Cross-layer ledger separation

*Transcript transport.*  Every layer's XMSS internal nodes belong to the one ledger
`xmssNodeAddresses vp`, so nothing separates two layers' `TREE` targets by type code.  What
separates them is the tree coordinate, and the layer bound is what makes it distinct. -/

variable {vp : ValidatedParams}

/-- Two different layers of one walk name two different XMSS tree coordinates.  The layer word of
`pos.advance j` is `pos.layer.val + j`, and both are below `d`, so the coordinates differ as soon
as the layers do.

This is the stronger of the two statements it forms a pair with.  `LayerPosition.advance_ne`
follows from it in one step, `fun h => layerTreeCoord_advance_ne pos hj hj' hne (congrArg
LayerTreeCoord.ofPosition h)`.  There is no step back: `advance_ne`'s conclusion is a disequality
of positions, and carrying that forward through `ofPosition` is exactly injectivity of `ofPosition`,
which builds `⟨pos.layer, pos.tree⟩` and so identifies the at-least-two leaves `Params.Valid.hp_pos`
gives every tree.  Neither is derived from the other here in any case: `advance_ne` is
*Deterministic inclusion* position arithmetic and would otherwise rest on this slice-1 coordinate
statement.

Each is what one family of ledgers needs — this one for the `hCollision` branch, whose ledger is
indexed by a `LayerTreeCoord`, and `advance_ne` for the three WOTS+ branches, whose ledgers are
indexed by the position or by a coordinate the position projects out of. -/

/-- Under the encoded-ledger conditions, XMSS internal-node targets at two different layers of one
walk carry different encoded tweaks.  Together with `xmssNodeAdrsKey_injective`, which separates
coordinates, heights and node indices, this is what stops two hypertree witnesses at different
layers from attacking the same tweak of `xmssHTcrCProblem`.

The conditions are consumed, not assumed afresh, so the SHA-2 zero fallback is never treated as
unreachable. -/
