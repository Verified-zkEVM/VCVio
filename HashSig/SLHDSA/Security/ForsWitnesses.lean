# FORS witnesses

Deterministic translations of a FORS public-key match into a concrete witness against one named
FORS component hash: a `T_k` second preimage of the honest root vector at the `FORS_ROOTS`
compression address, an ordered-pair collision of `H` at an exact `FORS_TREE` internal-node
address, or an `F`-preimage of an honest leaf image at an exact `FORS_TREE` leaf address.  The
case analysis is the Lean counterpart of three of the four branches of the FORS translation in the
EasyCrypt SPHINCS+ development (`FORS_ES.ec`, theorem `EUFCMA_MFORSTWESNPRF_OPRE` at `:3829`).

## What is proved, and what is not

Every *deterministic-inclusion* statement below has its free objects drawn from a primitive
bundle, a seed, a structural address, a message digest, a natural-number index, a FORS signature,
and the value a witness submits; not all of them mention all of those.  Twelve of the thirty
mention a `ForsSigCore` —
`forsRecoveredRoots` and its equation, `forsPkFromSig_eq_tl_recoveredRoots`, `forsRootsBinding`,
`forsTreeBinding`, `forsPkFromSig_cases`, the two extractors and the four lemmas about them — and
the other eighteen do not.  Of those eighteen only the three `_eval` bridges name a game at all,
and what they name is a `Problem` record, never an experiment or an advantage.

Unlike the WOTS+ witnesses, the honest secret seed is not confined to one lemma: the FORS honest
partner a witness attacks — the honest root vector, the honest child pair at an internal node, the
honest leaf image — is a function of the honest tree, and the honest tree is what `sk` generates.

The *transcript-transport* statements are about a role ledger over a `ValidatedParams`.  The two
membership lemmas take a bottom-layer position, a digest and a tree index, and
`mem_forsTreeAddresses_of_digest` a node height as well; the three encoded-distinctness lemmas take
a primitive bundle and an `EncodedTargetLedgerConditions`, and reach the ledger's coordinates
either as the argument of a `Function.Injective` (`forsLeafAdrsKey_injective`,
`forsRootAdrsKey_injective`) or as two coordinate tuples with their own range hypotheses
(`forsTreeAdrsKey_injective`).  None of the five mentions a signature or a secret seed.  Nothing
here constructs an adversary, states an advantage, performs a game hop, or claims that any honest
execution queried the honest value a witness attacks.  In particular a witness lemma is **not** a
reduction: that the game's target was committed before the forgery was seen is a
simulation-fidelity obligation of the later program-level slice, not a fact established here.

The FORS translation of `FORS_ES.ec` splits **four** ways, not three.  The fourth branch is
`valid_ITSR` (`FORS_ES.ec:3213`): every FORS leaf index the forged message opens was already
revealed by a signing query, and the forged pair itself was never queried.  It names no index of
its own — the FORS leaf index the honest signer never opened is chosen by the `find` at `:3223`,
which is meaningful exactly when the first of those two conjuncts fails.  `valid_ITSR` is a
statement about the digest transcript and the signing log, not about one FORS signature, and it is
deliberately absent here.  Consequently this module never establishes that a witness *index* is
unopened, which is the second half of the FORS-`F` winning condition (`FORS_ES.ec:4461`); only the
preimage half (`:4462`) is proved.

## Labels

*Deterministic inclusion* — a statement whose only free objects are `prims`, seeds, addresses,
a digest, natural-number indices, and signature or witness data:

* the four definitions `forsSigLeafIndex`, `forsHonestRoots`, `forsRecoveredRoots`,
  `forsHonestChildren`, with their equations `forsSigLeafIndex_eq`, `forsHonestRoots_getElem`,
  `forsRecoveredRoots_getElem`, `forsHonestChildren_eq`, `forsPkGen_eq_tl_honestRoots`,
  `forsPkFromSig_eq_tl_recoveredRoots`, and the index facts `forsSigLeafIndex_div_pow_a`,
  `forsSigLeafIndex_div_lt`;
* `forsRootsBinding`, `forsTreeBinding`, `forsLeafPreimage`, `forsPkFromSig_cases`;
* `ForsWitness`, `ForsWitness.Valid` and its three unfolding equations
  `ForsWitness.valid_tlCollision`, `ForsWitness.valid_hCollision`,
  `ForsWitness.valid_fPreimage`;
* `findForsTreeCollision`, `findForsTreeCollision_sound`, `findForsTreeCollision_isSome_of_ne`,
  `findForsTreeCollision_eq_none_imp`, `findForsWitness`, `findForsWitness_sound`;
* the three game-shape bridges `forsWitness_valid_tlCollision_eval`,
  `forsWitness_valid_hCollision_eval`, `forsWitness_valid_fPreimage_eval`.

These thirty and the five below are the module's whole interface.  The one further declaration,
`forsRecoveredRoot_climb`, is `private`: it re-spells the root hypothesis three proofs share and
adds nothing to what they conclude.

*Transcript transport* — a statement about a role ledger of `HashSig.SLHDSA.Security`:

* `mem_forsLeafAddresses_of_digest`, `mem_forsTreeAddresses_of_digest`;
* `forsLeafAdrsKey_injective`, `forsTreeAdrsKey_injective`, `forsRootAdrsKey_injective`.

The `T_k` witness address is `forsPkAdrs pos.forsAdrs`, which `mem_forsRootAddresses` already
lists in the `forsTl` ledger; that lemma is used directly rather than restated.

The three encoded-distinctness lemmas consume `EncodedTargetLedgerConditions` rather than assuming
a fresh injectivity hypothesis, so a concrete profile discharges them through
`approvedEncodedTargetLedgerConditions`; the SHA-2 zero fallback is therefore never treated as
unreachable.

## The case analysis

Fix a digest `md`, a FORS signature `sig`, and the honest key material `(sk, pk)` at the
instance address `adrs`.  Recovery compresses the `k` roots `sig` climbs to, and key generation
compresses the `k` honest roots; a public-key match therefore equates the two `T_k` images.
Either the two root vectors differ — a `T_k` second preimage at `forsPkAdrs adrs`, the residual
TRCO branch of `FORS_ES.ec:6346-6355`, whose core is `eq_from_flatten_nth` (`:871`) — or they
agree entry by entry.  In the latter case each tree `i` climbs the forged opening of the honest
leaf index `forsSigLeafIndex p md i` to the honest tree-`i` root, and at each tree either the
forged leaf image differs from the honest one, and `PerfectMerkleTree.climb_binding` extracts an
`H`-collision at an internal node on that leaf's root path — the `valid_TRHTCR` branch
(`FORS_ES.ec:3242`), whose extractor is `extract_collision_bt_ap_trh` (`:729`) over `ecbtapP`
(`MerkleTrees.ec:152`) — or it agrees, and the revealed secret value is an `F`-preimage of the
honest leaf image — the `valid_OpenPRE` branch (`:3231`).

This is a *reordering* of the source's split, not a restriction of it.  `FORS_ES.ec` decides its
two leaf-level events at the one ITSR-selected tree `dftidx` (`:3223`): `valid_OpenPRE` (`:3231`)
compares the forged and honest leaf images there, and `valid_TRHTCR` (`:3242`) the forged and
honest roots of that one tree.  The residual TRCO branch names no tree at all — its case bound is
`!valid_ITSR ∧ !valid_TRHTCR` and it ranges over FORS instances, `0 <= i < d` (`:6346-6355`).
OpenPRE is tried before TRHTCR: the case bounds are `!valid_ITSR ∧ valid_OpenPRE` (`:4457-4458`)
and then `!valid_ITSR ∧ !valid_OpenPRE ∧ valid_TRHTCR` (`:5786-5788`).  The split here is
instance-wide and prefers the `H` branch instead: it fires when the two root vectors agree and
*some* tree's forged leaf image differs, and the `F` branch when they agree and *every* tree's
image agrees.

The comparison with the source runs one way against its *events* and, for the `H` branch, the other
way against its *cases*, so it is worth stating twice.  Against the events, both branches are
strictly contained.  The `F` branch forces every tree's image to agree, hence `dftidx`'s, hence
`valid_OpenPRE`; the `H` branch forces every recovered root to be honest, hence `dftidx`'s, hence
`valid_TRHTCR`, which asks that of the ITSR-selected tree alone.  Both containments are strict: a
forgery whose root vectors agree and whose `dftidx` image agrees while some other tree's differs
satisfies `valid_OpenPRE` and is routed here to `H`, and one whose `dftidx` root is honest while
some other tree's is not satisfies `valid_TRHTCR` and is routed here to `T_k`.  Restricted to
forgeries whose two root vectors agree — where this module does not take its `T_k` branch, and the
source, with `valid_TRHTCR` holding, does not take TRCO — the `H` comparison turns around: the
source's TRHTCR case bound is then `!valid_ITSR` together with `dftidx`'s image differing, and
*some* tree's image differing is strictly wider than that, while the `F` branch stays strictly
narrower than `valid_OpenPRE`.

Each branch still yields a witness against a different one of the three FORS component hashes —
for `F`, the hash half of the winning condition only, the unopened-index half being the ITSR
branch's — so the reordering changes which forgeries reach which game, not which three games are
reached.  No branch wins a game by itself.  The events are not in one-to-one correspondence with
the source's, and it is `findForsWitness`'s `target` that lets a later assembly submit the `F`
witness at the ITSR-selected tree.

The FORS-`F` branch is an **open-preimage** witness, not a target-collision one.  The
source's postcondition (`FORS_ES.ec:4454-4462`) asks for an index in range, an index the signer
never opened, and `f pp tw x = y`; it carries no `x <> x'`, and the winning condition of
`SM_DT_OpenPRE_SourceFinalValidity.Experiment` carries none either.  A value equal to the honest
secret is therefore allowed to win, and adding a distinctness hypothesis here would state
something strictly stronger than the source establishes and strictly stronger than the game needs.

`MultiExtractability` is deliberately not imported: it is a probabilistic shared-ROM game over
sequential checkpoints and pruned batch openings, whereas the collision needed here is against one
fixed honest tree, which is exactly what `PerfectMerkleTree.findCollision` and `climb_binding`
give.

compresses its recovered roots to the same `T_k` image as the honest roots, at `forsPkAdrs adrs`.

This is only half of a `T_k` second preimage: that the two root vectors *differ* is the caller's
case split, and `forsPkFromSig_cases` is what supplies it.  The EasyCrypt counterpart is the
residual TRCO branch (`FORS_ES.ec:6346-6355`), whose core is `eq_from_flatten_nth` (`:871`).

its forged leaf image differs from the honest leaf image, then some internal node of height
`0 < z ≤ a` on the opened leaf's root path carries an `H`-collision between the honest child pair
there and a second, different pair — at exactly the address
`forsNodeAdrs adrs z (forsSigLeafIndex p md i / 2 ^ z)`.

This is the `valid_TRHTCR` branch (`FORS_ES.ec:3242`, postcondition `:5783-5792`); the extractor
is `extract_collision_bt_ap_trh` (`:729`), whose correctness is `ecbtapP` (`MerkleTrees.ec:152`).
The Lean port already exists as `PerfectMerkleTree.climb_binding`, and the orientation matches:
`ecbtapP` returns the honest child pair first, and so does `climb_binding`.

*a* preimage of the recorded image, and `SM_DT_OpenPRE_SourceFinalValidity.Experiment`'s winning
condition asks only that too.  The remaining half of that postcondition — that the index was never
opened (`:4461`) — is the `valid_ITSR` branch and is not proved here.

*every* tree, an `F`-preimage of that tree's honest leaf image.

The proof splits on whether the recovered roots equal the honest ones, and then on whether some
tree's forged leaf image differs from the honest one.  It is exhaustive by construction: both
splits are decisions on a proposition and its negation.

These are the three non-ITSR branches of the four-way FORS split of `FORS_ES.ec`
(`EUFCMA_MFORSTWESNPRF_OPRE`, `:3829`); the fourth, `valid_ITSR` (`:3213`), is an event about the

/-! ## The extracted witness

`ForsWitness` packages the three outcomes as the data a reduction submits: the recovered root
vector, an adversarial child pair together with the tree and the height that name its tweak, or
the revealed secret value together with the tree that names its tweak.  Every honest object a
witness attacks is an argument of `ForsWitness.Valid` and never a constructor field: `Valid` takes
the honest secret seed, the public seed, the instance address and the digest, and from them
*computes* the honest root vector, the honest child pair at the named node, and the honest leaf
image at the named tree's opened leaf.

That computation is the identification a source-final-validity game needs: its winning condition
compares the submitted value against the challenge *recorded* at the named target, so a pair of
arbitrary distinct values with equal images is not a win.  `ForsWitness.Valid` therefore carries
the hash-value half of that winning condition — for the two collision branches the distinctness
and the equal images, for the preimage branch the equal images alone, against a partner the
predicate names rather than quantifies over — together with the height bounds that place the
address in a role ledger, and nothing beyond that.  It does not assert that the honest object was
recorded as a game target, that the preimage branch's index was never opened, or anything about
the rest of a transcript; those are program-level obligations of the reduction.

Only one digest appears, the one the witness is submitted against.  A second, honest digest does
not, because — unlike the WOTS+ case,
where the honest partner is read off the honest signature — every FORS honest partner is a
function of the honest tree, which `sk` generates. -/

/-- A witness against one FORS component hash at a fixed instance address.

Each constructor carries only the value a reduction submits, together with the coordinates that
name its tweak: the tree number and the tree height for the `H` branch, the tree number alone for
the `F` branch.  The `T_k` tweak is named by `adrs` alone, so `tlCollision` carries no coordinate;
and the `H` branch's horizontal node index is not carried either, because the tree number and the
digest already fix it.  Every honest
object a witness attacks is supplied to `ForsWitness.Valid`, which reads it off the honest tree. -/
inductive ForsWitness (p : Params) (prims : Primitives p) where
  /-- A second preimage of the honest FORS root vector under `T_k` at `forsPkAdrs adrs`. -/
  | tlCollision (recovered : Vector prims.Y p.k)
  /-- An `H`-collision at the height-`height` node of tree `tree`'s opened root path.  `children`
  is the submitted pair; the honest pair it collides with is not carried here but computed by
  `ForsWitness.Valid` from the honest tree. -/
  | hCollision (tree : Fin p.k) (height : ℕ) (children : prims.Y × prims.Y)
  /-- An `F`-preimage of the honest leaf image at the leaf tree `tree` opens. -/
  | fPreimage (tree : Fin p.k) (value : prims.Y)

/-- The winning condition each witness asserts, against the honest tree that `sk` generates at
`adrs` under the public seed `pk`, at the digest `md` — the forged one, in the intended use, though
nothing here requires `md` to be a forgery's.

Write `idx = forsSigLeafIndex p md tree` for the global leaf index the digest opens in tree
`tree`.  Then:

* `tlCollision recovered` asserts a `T_k` second preimage of `forsHonestRoots prims sk pk adrs`
  at `forsPkAdrs adrs`;
* `hCollision tree height children` asserts an `H`-collision at
  `forsNodeAdrs adrs height (idx / 2 ^ height)` between `children` and
  `forsHonestChildren prims sk pk adrs height (idx / 2 ^ height)`, the honest child pair there,
  and pins `0 < height ≤ a`.  Both bounds are load-bearing: `height ≤ a` is what places the
  address in the `forsH` ledger, and `0 < height` is what keeps it out of the `forsF` one —
  `forsNodeAdrs adrs 0 t` is a FORS *leaf* address, and it is also the height at which
  `forsHonestChildren`'s `height - 1` would truncate;
* `fPreimage tree value` asserts that `value` is an `F`-preimage at `forsNodeAdrs adrs 0 idx` of
  the honest leaf image there.  There is deliberately no distinctness conjunct: the FORS-`F`
  branch is an open-preimage witness, and the honest secret value itself is allowed to win.

The two distinctness conjuncts are oriented differently.  `tlCollision`'s reads submitted-first,
`recovered ≠ forsHonestRoots …`, which is the order
`SM_DT_TCR_SourceFinalValidity.Experiment` tests (`m ≠ mj`, the submitted message first); the
`hCollision` one reads honest-first, inherited from `PerfectMerkleTree.findCollision_sound`, whose
`c₁ ≠ c₂` names the honest pair first.  Nothing turns on it — a consumer that wants the game's
order applies `Ne.symm` — but the two branches of this one predicate do not agree.

This is a statement about hash values only.  It does not say that the honest roots, the honest
child pair, or the honest leaf image was committed as a game target, nor that any execution
queried them, nor — in the `fPreimage` case — that the named index was never opened. -/

The first branch is decided by the root vectors alone, not by the two public keys.  On a signature
whose recovered public key differs this therefore still returns a `tlCollision`, and that witness

`target` is the caller's choice of tree for the preimage branch.  In the source that choice is the
ITSR one — `find (fun i => ! i ∈ lidxs) lidxs'` (`FORS_ES.ec:3223`), the only choice point in the
whole FORS translation — and it needs the signing log, which is not available here.  Every tree is

/-! ## Ledger membership and encoded distinctness

*Transcript transport.*  Every address a witness names at a reachable bottom-layer position is a
member of the slice-1 role ledger it is submitted against, and — under
`EncodedTargetLedgerConditions` — distinct addresses of one ledger carry distinct encoded tweaks.
The three roles are reached separately, because they have three different ledgers:

* the `fPreimage` witness attacks `forsF`, whose ledger is `forsLeafAddresses`
  (`mem_forsLeafAddresses_of_digest`, `forsLeafAdrsKey_injective`);
* the `hCollision` witness attacks `forsH`, whose ledger is `forsTreeAddresses`
  (`mem_forsTreeAddresses_of_digest`, `forsTreeAdrsKey_injective`);
* the `tlCollision` witness attacks `forsTl`, whose ledger is `forsRootAddresses`; its address is
  literally `forsPkAdrs pos.forsAdrs`, which `mem_forsRootAddresses` already lists, so that lemma
  is used directly rather than restated.  Distinctness of its encoded tweaks is
  `forsRootAdrsKey_injective`.

These are statements about the ledgers, not about any execution: nothing here says a logged query
carried the witness values, and nothing here says the `fPreimage` index was unopened. -/

/-! ## Game shapes

`ForsWitness.Valid` is stated in the construction's own vocabulary (`prims.F`, `prims.H`,
`prims.Tl` at a structural `Adrs`).  These three bridges rewrite it into the canonical games'
`eval` vocabulary at the encoded tweak, using the attacked-member equations of
`HashSig.SLHDSA.Security.CanonicalGames`.  All three take the same explicit prefix — the honest
seeds, the instance address and the digest — then the branch's own data and the validity
hypothesis, and all three rewrite *both* sides of their hash equation, so every hash equation they
conclude is stated in the game's vocabulary.  The remaining conjuncts are carried through unchanged
and stay in the construction's: the `H` branch's two height bounds, which are ledger-placement
conditions no game states, and the two distinctness conjuncts, which name `forsHonestRoots` and
`forsHonestChildren` directly.  They change presentation only: no game is played and no advantage
is stated.

The `fPreimage` bridge lands in `forsFOpenPreProblem` and not in `forsFTcrProblem`, for the reason
the case-analysis section gives.  Slice 6's `forsFTcrProblem_eq_toTCR` and
`forsFDsprProblem_eq_toDSPR` are the route to the other two FORS-`F` games, and they are generic;
nothing here needs a TCR- or DSPR-shaped FORS-`F` bridge. -/
