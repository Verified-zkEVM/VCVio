# WOTS+ Message-Encoding Injectivity

The full-width WOTS+ message encoding of FIPS 205 Algorithms 7 and 8 (lines 1–7) determines the
node being signed, and any two distinct nodes have a chain on which the first node's step count
is strictly smaller than the second's.

Two facts combine here. `WotsEncoding.base2b_msg_injective` shows that under the alignment
obligation `lgw ∣ 8n` of `Params.Valid` the `len1` message digits lose no bit of the `n`-byte
message; `CorePrimitives.ByteLaws` transports that from the byte encoding to the abstract node
carrier `core.Y`. `WotsChecksum.wots_fullDigits_incomparable` is the purely combinatorial
statement that distinct message-digit vectors yield pointwise-incomparable full digit vectors.
Together they give `chainLengthsCore_incomparable` and its index-wise form
`chainStepsCore_two_encodings`: for `msg ≠ msg'` some chain index `i < len` has
`chainStepsCore core msg i < chainStepsCore core msg' i`. That statement is the Lean
counterpart of the `two_encodings` axiom of the EasyCrypt SPHINCS+ proof (`WOTS_TW_ES.ec`),
which is the only fact about the message encoding that proof assumes; here it is proved for the
concrete FIPS 205 encoding, under `p.Valid` and `core.ByteLaws`.

/-- Two distinct nodes have a chain index at which the first node's step count is strictly
smaller than the second's. This is the combinatorial ingredient a WOTS+ unforgeability
reduction consumes, instantiated with the forgery target as `msg` and the honestly signed
message as `msg'`: at the witnessing index the target's step count is strictly below the
signed one, so a forger who only advances the honest signer's chains cannot reach the target's
encoding. The EasyCrypt SPHINCS+ proof's forgery-side use of its axiom is exactly this swapped
form (`two_encodings m' m` in `nhchwcoll_hchwpre`, `WOTS_TW_ES.ec`). The statement is the
index-wise reading of the second conjunct of `chainLengthsCore_incomparable`, and the Lean
counterpart of the EasyCrypt `two_encodings` axiom. -/
